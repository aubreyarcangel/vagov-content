## How much does a burial in a private cemetery cost? 

It depends. We provide memorial items to you and your family at no extra cost. But a private cemetery may charge setting, placement, maintenance, or other fees. We recommend you ask about these additional costs when planning a burial in a private cemetery. 

## Can I use a burial allowance for a private cemetery burial? 

Yes. [Learn more about burial allowances and find out how to apply.](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/veterans-burial-allowance/)


## What questions should I ask to prepare for a private cemetery burial? 

If you’re planning a burial in a private cemetery, you may want to ask these questions to the cemetery you’re working with:
<br>

- Am I required to buy an additional gravesite (if the cemetery offers a free gravesite for Veterans)?
- If I have to buy an additional gravesite, what will it cost? Where will it be located?
- Can you give me a written list of what services my family and I will receive during the burial process?  
- Can you give me a written list of what information or resources I need to give you in order to plan the burial? 
- Do you offer a trust fund to protect buyers? 
- Are there any requirements or restrictions on headstones or gravemarkers in your cemetery?
- Do I need to buy a special marker base before ordering a headstone from VA?
- Does it cost money to place, set, or take care of a VA headstone or marker? If yes, will this cost more than if I buy a private headstone or marker?
- Do I need to buy an outside container (sometimes called a “vault” or a “grave liner”)? If yes, how much will this cost?

## Is a spouse or dependent eligible for memorial items if they're buried in private cemetery?

No. Only an eligible Veteran can receive a headstone, marker or medallion for burial in a private cemetery. 

## What should I do if the Veteran's grave is still unmarked?

**If the Veteran's grave is still unmarked and more than 30 days have passed since you filed your claim:**

Call us at <a href="tel:+18006976947">800-697-6947</a> to make sure we received your claim. We’re available Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. ET. <br>

**If you know we’ve received your claim and more than 60 days have passed:**

Contact the cemetery, funeral home, or other party responsible for accepting delivery of the headstone, marker or medallion. If they haven’t received it, please call us at the number above.

## What should I do if I need to file a complaint?

If you have a complaint about a private cemetery policy, there are organizations that can help you resolve it.
