## Memorial items

### Is a Veteran buried in a private cemetery eligible for memorial items?

Yes. Veterans buried in a private cemetery may be eligible for these memorial items:

- Headstone, marker, or medallion
- Burial flag
- Presidential Memorial Certificate

[See if you’re eligible for a memorial item and learn how to apply](/burials-memorials/memorial-items/headstones-markers-medallions/)

### If I'm planning my own burial in a private cemetery, can I find out which memorial items I'm eligible for? 

Yes. You can find out which burial benefits you're eligible for by filling out the [Pre-need Eligibility application](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/pre-need-eligibility/). This application can be used to determine if you can get a VA headstone or marker. 

If you want to be buried in a private cemetery, the Pre-need Eligibility application will help your family as they plan your burial. **Note:** When a family member submits a [Claim for Standard Government Headstone or Marker](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/va40-1330.pdf), please include this note in box 27: "Decedent has a VA pre-need decision letter."

**Please note:** “Pre-need” means before the time of need. This application is for planning for your own burial in advance. Please don’t complete the Pre-need eligibility application if you’re requesting burial at the time of need.

### Is a family member buried in a private cemetery eligible for memorial items?

No. A family member buried in a private cemetery isn't eligible for VA memorial items. Only an eligible Veteran can receive a headstone, marker, or medallion for burial in a private cemetery. <br>

And if a Veteran is buried at a private cemetery, we can't pay to have a family member's date of birth or death inscribed on their headstone or marker. 

## Private cemetery burial costs

### How much does a burial in a private cemetery cost?

It depends. We provide memorial items to you and your family at no extra cost. But a private cemetery may charge setting, placement, maintenance, or other fees. We recommend you ask about these additional costs when planning a burial in a private cemetery. 

### Can VA help with the cost of a Veteran's burial in a private cemetery?

Yes. If a Veteran is eligible, we can help you with the cost of their burial.

## More information about burial in a private cemetery
### What questions should I ask to prepare for a private cemetery burial? 

If you’re planning a burial in a private cemetery, you may want to ask these questions to the cemetery you’re working with:
<br>

- If the private cemetery is offering a free gravesite for Veterans, will I be required to buy a gravesite in addition to the free Veteran gravesite?
- If I have to buy an additional gravesite, what will it cost? Where will it be located?
- Can I get a written list of the services my family and I will get from the private cemetery during the burial process?  
- Can I get a written list of the information or resources I need to give the private cemetery in order to plan the burial? 
- What type of trust fund does the private cemetery have to protect buyers? 
- Are there any requirements or restrictions on headstones or gravemarkers in the private cemetery?
- Do I need to buy a special marker base before ordering a VA headstone?
- Will I have to pay to place, set, or take care of a VA headstone or marker? If yes, will this cost more than if I buy a private headstone or marker?
- Do I need to buy an outer container (sometimes called a “vault” or a “grave liner”) to surround the casket? If yes, how much will this cost?
