## How much does a burial in a private cemetery cost? 

It depends. We provide memorial items to you and your family at no extra cost. But a private cemetery may charge setting, placement, maintenance, or other fees. We recommend you ask about these additional costs when planning a burial in a private cemetery. 

## Can I use a burial allowance for a private cemetery burial? 

Yes. [Learn more about burial allowances and find out how to apply.](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/veterans-burial-allowance/)


## What questions should I ask to prepare for a private cemetery burial? 

If you’re planning a burial in a private cemetery, you may want to ask these questions to the cemetery you’re working with:
<br>

- Am I required to buy an additional gravesite (if the cemetery offers a free gravesite for Veterans)?
- If I have to buy an additional gravesite, what will it cost? Where will it be located?
- Can you give me a written list of what services my family and I will receive during the burial process?  
- Can you give me a written list of what information or resources I need to give you in order to plan the burial? 
- Do you offer a trust fund to protect buyers? 
- Are there any headstone or gravemarker requirements or restrictions?
- Do I need to buy a special marker base before ordering a government headstone?
- Does it cost money to place, set, or take care of a government headstone or marker? If yes, will this cost more than if I buy a private headstone or marker?
- Do I need to buy an outside container (sometimes called a “vault” or a “grave liner”)? If yes, how much will this cost?
- Can you give me a written list of what I’ll receive during the burial process?  
- Can you give me a written list of what information or resources I need to give you in order to plan the burial?
