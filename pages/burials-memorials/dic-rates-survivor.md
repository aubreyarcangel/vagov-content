### Added amounts

As the surviving spouse of a Veteran, you may qualify for more money each month based on certain factors.

| **If this is true for you** | **You may qualify for this benefit** | **Added monthly amount** |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| <ul><li>Your Veteran spouse had a VA rating of totally disabling for at least the 8 years before their death (without a break), **and**</li><li>You were married to the Veteran for those same 8 years</li> | 8-year provision | 280.09 |

| You can't leave your house due to a disability | Housebound allowance | 153.08 |
| You have 1 or more children who are under 18 years  | <ul><li>Transitional benefits</li><li>DIC apportionment rates</li></ul> | 153.08 each month | <ul><li>282.00 (for 2 years after the Veteran's death)</li><li>326.77 per child</li> |

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="how-to-spouse">How to use these tables</button>
<div id="how-to-spouse" class="usa-accordion-content">

Start with the **Basic rates** table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then find the basic monthly rate to the right. Then, look at the **Added amounts** tables. Find each of the descriptions that are true for you and add the corresponding added amount to your basic rate to get your total monthly payment.

**For example:** If you were the qualified surviving spouse of a Veteran who qualified for the 8-year provision, and you qualified for Aid and Attendance, and you had 2 children under 18 years, you would calculate your rate as below.

- **Total monthly payment for the first 2 years:** $1,319.04 (basic rate) + $280.09 (8-year provision) + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) + $326.77 (1st child under 18 years) + $326.77 (2nd child under 18 years) + $282.00 (transitional benefit) = **$2,771.44**

- **Total monthly payment after 2 years (when transitional benefit stops):** $1,319.04 (basic rate) + $280.09 (8-year provision) + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) + $326.77 (1st child under 18 years) + $326.77 (2nd child under 18 years) = **$2,489.44**

## DIC rates for survivors of a Veteran who died before January 1, 1993 
**Effective December 1, 2018**

If your Veteran spouse or parent died before January 1, 1993, we'll use a different method to calculate your DIC monthly payments.

### Surviving spouse, with or without dependent children

To find your monthly DIC rate, click on the Veteran's pay grade category. Find the Veteran's specific pay grade in the left column of the **Basic monthly rates** table, and the matching monthly payment amount to the right. Then, add any added or increase amounts that apply to you, based the Veteran's disability status before death and whether you have dependent children under the age of 18 years.
