| ---| ---: | ---: | 
| <ul><li>You were married to the Veteran for the 8 full years leading up to their death, **and**</li><li>The Veteran had a VA service-connected disability rating of totally disabling for those entire 8 years</li></ul> | 8-year provision | 280.09 |

### Example of how to calculate your monthly payment amount

If you were the qualified surviving spouse of a Veteran who qualified for the 8-year provision, **and** you qualified for Aid and Attendance, **and** you had 2 children under 18, you would calculate your rate as below.

- **Total monthly payment for the first 2 years:** $1,319.04 (basic rate) + $280.09 (8-year provision) + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) + $326.77 (1st child under 18) + $326.77 (2nd child under 18) + $282.00 (transitional benefit) = **$2,771.44**

- **Total monthly payment after 2 years (when transitional benefit stops):** $1,319.04 (basic rate) + $280.09 (8-year provision) + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) + $326.77 (1st child under 18) + $326.77 (2nd child under 18) = **$2,489.44**

## VA DIC rates if the Veteran died before January 1, 1993 
**Effective December 1, 2018**

If your Veteran spouse or parent died before January 1, 1993, we'll use a different method to calculate your DIC monthly payments.

### Surviving spouse, with or without dependent children

To find your monthly payment amount, click on the Veteran's pay grade category. Find the Veteran's specific pay grade in the left column of the **Basic monthly rates** table, and the matching monthly payment amount to the right. 

Then, go to the **Added or increased amounts** table. Add any added or increased amounts that apply to you, based on the Veteran's disability rating and whether you have dependent children under the age of 18 years.

### Surviving unmarried child

#### If child is over 18 years of age and the Veteran's surviving spouse is also eligible for DIC

| --- | ---: |
| Child between the ages of 18 and 23 years who's in a qualified school program | 276.84 |

**Note:** We define a helpless child as an adult child who became permanently unable to support themself before the age of 18.

#### If the Veteran doesn't have a surviving spouse who is eligible for DIC

We'll base your payment amount on the number of the Veteran's eligible surviving children. In the table below, the monthly rate for each child shows how much you'll receive each month if we pay each child separately. The total monthly payment shows how much your family will receive if we pay you in one lump sum each month.

## How your DIC payments may impact your Survivor Benefit Plan

### What's a Survivor Benefit Plan?

The Survivor Benefit Program is a voluntary annuity program that service members may purchase as a retirement benefit for family members. An annuity is a monthly payment received for life. Depending on the branch of service, members may buy a Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) or Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP).

We don't manage this program. It's managed by the Department of Defense's Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). 

### Can I receive SBP or RCSBP payments and DIC payments at the same time?

In most cases, you can't receive a full SBP or RCSBP payment and a full DIC payment at the same time. 

**Exception:** If you're receiving an SBP or RCSBP annuity from one spouse, but then remarry after age 57 and become eligible for DIC based on the service-connected disability of another spouse, you can receive full benefits through each program. 

### What happens if I'm receiving SBP or RCSBP payments and then qualify for DIC and the exception above doesn't apply to me?

DFAS will reduce your SBP or RCSBP by the amount of your DIC payment. If your DIC payment amount is greater than your total SBP or RCSBP payment, DFAS will stop your SBP or RCSBP payments. This is called the "SBP/DIC offset."

If DFAS pays you more than the offset amount in SBP or RCSBP payments after you begin receiving DIC payments, they'll consider this amount an overpayment. This means you'll have to pay the money back.

Be sure to notify DFAS as soon as you qualify for DIC so they can reduce your SBP or RCSBP payment amount and you can avoid owing money. You'll need to send them a copy of your VA DIC award letter. You can all DFAS at <a href="tel:+18003211080">800-321-1080</a>, Monday to Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET.
