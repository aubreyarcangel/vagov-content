<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="how-to-spouse">How to use these tables to find your monthly payment as a surviving spouse</button>
<div id="how-to-spouse" class="usa-accordion-content">

Start with the **Basic rates** table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then find the basic monthly rate to the right. Then, look at the **Added amounts** tables. Find each of the descriptions that are true for you and add the corresponding added amount to your basic rate to get your total monthly payment.

**For example:** If you were the qualified surviving spouse of a Veteran who qualified for the 8-year provision, and you qualified for Aid and Attendance, and you had 2 children under 18 years, you would calculate your rate as below.

- **Total monthly payment for the first 2 years:** $1,319.04 (basic rate) + $280.09 (8-year provision) + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) + $326.77 (1st child under 18 years) + $326.77 (2nd child under 18 years) + $282.00 (transitional benefit) = **$2,771.44**

- **Total monthly payment after 2 years (when transitional benefit stops):** $1,319.04 (basic rate) + $280.09 (8-year provision) + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) + $326.77 (1st child under 18 years) + $326.77 (2nd child under 18 years) = **$2,489.44**

## DIC rates for survivors of a Veteran who died before January 1, 1993

- The Veteran's pay grade, **and**
- Whether or not the Veteran qualifies for the 8-year provision
- Whether or not you have dependent children under the age of 18 years

**Note:** The Veteran qualifies for the 8-year provision if...

### Examples of how to use these charts

These two examples show how the rates may differ.

**Example 1:**

**The surviving spouse was married to a Veteran whose pay grade was E-1, and has two children.**

Basic rate for spouse: $1,319.04</br>
Child 1: $326.77</br>
Child 2: $326.77

The Veteran was rated totally disabled for 8 continuous years before death, and if the surviving spouse was married to the Veteran those same 8 years (also known as the 8-year provision): $280.09

**Total: $2,252.67**

**Example 2:**

**The surviving spouse was married to a Veteran whose pay grade was O-6, and has two children.**

Basic rate for spouse: $2,024.71</br>
Child 1: $326.77</br>
Child 2: $326.77

The Veteran was *not* rated totally disabled for 8 continuous years before death, and if the surviving spouse was married to the Veteran those same 8 years (also known as the 8-year provision): $0

**Total: $2,678.25**

### Surviving children who are over 18 years of age, when the Veteran's surviving spouse is also eligible for DIC

#### Surviving children when the Veteran doesn't have a surviving spouse who is eligible for DIC

We'll base your payment amount on the number of eligible surviving children.
