## DIC benefits for children of Veterans

We base Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits on the highest pay grade that the Veteran held for 6 months of active duty. We base the rates for children on several factors:

-	The Veteran’s pay grade
-	Whether the surviving spouse was entitled to benefits
-	Whether the child was sharing benefits with other children

The charts below show the current benefit rates.
