<div class="va-introtext">

You can apply to find out in advance if you can be buried in a VA national cemetery. This is called a pre-need determination of eligibility—and it can help make the burial planning process easier for your family members in their time of need. Follow the steps below to apply.

</div>

**Please note:** "Pre-need" means before the time of need. This application is for planning for your own burial in advance. Please don't complete this form if you're requesting burial at the time of need.<br/>

## How do I prepare before starting my application?

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

### Find out if you're eligible. One of these must describe you:
- A Veteran who didn't receive a dishonorable discharge when you separated from the military, **or**
- The spouse or dependent child of a service member or Veteran, even if the service member or Veteran has already passed away, **or**
- In some cases, the adult dependent child of a service member or Veteran (if you aren’t married)

We base our decision of whether or not you qualify for burial in a VA national cemetery on your service history—or the service history of the Veteran or service member who's sponsoring your application for burial as a spouse, surviving spouse, or unmarried adult child.<br>

**Note:** Active-duty service members don't need to apply for a pre-need determination of eligibility. If a service member dies on active duty, they're eligible for burial without a pre-need decision letter.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

### Choose the VA national cemetery where you’d prefer to be buried. <br>
[Find a VA national cemetery](/find-locations/)

**Please note:**

- **This application is only for VA national cemeteries.** If you'd like to be buried in a state or tribal Veterans cemetery, contact that specific cemetery ahead of time to find out about their pre-need program. Some state Veterans cemeteries require that you live in that state or have other rules around eligibility. You can apply for a pre-need determination of eligibility from VA and also from a state or tribal Veterans cemetery.<br>
[Find a state Veterans cemetery](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/index.asp)

- **This application doesn’t apply to Arlington National Cemetery or the United States Soldiers and Airmen's Home National Cemetery.** If you'd like to be buried in either of these Department of the Army cemeteries, please call <a href="tel:+18779078585">877-907-8585</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. <abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>, and Saturday, 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. <abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>.

- **Getting a pre-need determination of eligibility doesn’t guarantee you’ll be buried in a specific VA national cemetery.** We ask you where you'd prefer to be buried so we can try to help fulfill your final wishes. But, when we receive a request for burial from the person handling your burial arrangements, we'll assign a gravesite in a cemetery with available space at the time of need. We make assignments without regard to rank, ethnic or religious background, branch of service, or other factors. 

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

### Gather the supporting documents and information you’ll need to fill out the application.

Please see the list below. If you don’t have everything on the list, you can still apply and we'll help by finding the supporting documents we need. Just keep in mind that the more information you can give us when you apply, the faster we can review your application and give you a decision. We'll contact you if we need you to provide additional information.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">

### Be sure to fill out an application for each person requesting a pre-need eligibility determination.

If both you and your spouse are applying, you’ll each need to fill out your own application.<br>
**Note:** We recommend that you don't submit a pre-need burial application for most children. This is because most children  reach an age where their eligibility expires.

</li>
</ol>
