<h5> How to use this table to find your monthly payment amount</h5>

Find the amount in the first column that’s closest to your monthly income when rounded up to the next level. The amount to the right is your beginning rate.

**For example:** If you made $2,353 a month, you would round up to $2,400. So your beginning rate would be $524.

Then, if your income is less than the amount you rounded up to, use the **$1 decrement** decimal to the right of your beginning rate to calculate your total monthly payment amount. To do this:

- Start with your actual monthly income. Subtract the previous level's dollar amount.
- Multiply the new amount by the decrement.
- Then, add that armount to your beginning monthly rate to get your full monthly payment amount.

**Using our example:** 

- $2,353 (your actual monthly income) - $2,300 (the amount in the previous level) - **$53**
- $53 X .08 (decrement) = $4.24
- $4.24 + $524 (your beginning monthly rate) = **$528.24 total monthly payment**

**Using our example:**

$528.24 (total monthly payment) + $353 (Aid and Attendance) = **$881.24 total monthly payment**
