## Rates if only 1 parent is alive

These rates apply to you if you're [eligible for VA DIC as a surviving parent](/burials-memorials/dependency-indemnity-compensation/) and both of the below descriptions are true for you.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You're the Veteran's only surviving parent, **and**
- Either you're not remarried or you're remarried and living with your spouse

### Find your rate based on your yearly income

Click on the income range that applies to you. Then, follow the directions below the table to calculate your monthly payment. 

**Note:** Your yearly income is how much money you earn during one calendar year (January 1 to December 31). This includes income from all sources, such as wages, salary, investment payments, rental properties, gifts, income of dependents living in your home, and some retirement payments. If you're remarried and living with your spouse, this also includes your spouse's income. 

If you'd like to read more about how we determine your income, please go to the [Full Title 38 regulations](#title-38) section below.

<h5>How to use this table to calculate your monthly payment</h5>

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one"><strong>Find your beginning monthly rate in the table above.</strong> <br> To do this, find the income limit amount in the first column that’s closest to your income when rounded up. The amount listed to the right, in the middle column, is your beginning monthly rate. <br><br><strong>For example:</strong> If you earn $1,353 a year, you would round up to the $1,400 income limit. Your beginning monthly rate would be <strong>$604</strong>.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-two"><strong>Calculate the difference between your actual income and the income limit that's closest to your income when rounded down.</strong>

  <li class="process-step list-three"><strong>Multiply this amount by the rate of decrease.</strong> <br> The rate of decrease is the decimal listed in the last column. It helps us adjust your rate to match your actual income.<br><br><strong>Using our example:</strong> $53 x .08 (rate of decrease) = <strong>$4.24</strong></li>
  <li class="process-step list-four"><strong>Add this amount to your beginning monthly rate.</strong><br>The total is your monthly payment.<br><br><strong>Using our example:</strong> $4.24 + $604 (beginning monthly rate) = <strong>$608.24</strong> (monthly payment) </li>
   <li class="process-step list-five"><strong>If you're eligible for <a href="/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/">Aid and Attendance</a>, add $353.</strong><br> The total is your monthly payment with Aid and Attendance.<br><br><strong>Using our example:</strong> $608.24 (monthly payment) + $353 (Aid and Attendance) = <strong>$961.24</strong> (monthly payment with Aid and Attendance)</li>

<h5>Your payment schedule</h5>

How often you'll get a payment depends on your total amount for the year.

**If your monthly payments add up to:**

<ul>
  <li><strong>More than $228,</strong> we'll pay you monthly.
  <li><strong>Between $144 and $228,</strong> we'll pay you 4 times a year, or 1 payment every 3 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Between $72 and $144,</strong> we'll pay you 2 times a year, or 1 payment every 6 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Less than $72,</strong> we'll pay you once a year.</li>

<h5>How to use this table to calculate your monthly payment</h5>

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one"><strong>Find your beginning monthly rate in the table above.</strong> <br> To do this, find the income limit amount in the first column that’s closest to your income when rounded up. The amount listed to the right is your beginning monthly rate. <br><br><strong>For example:</strong> If you earned $2,353 a year, you would round your income up to the $2,400 income limit. So your beginning monthly rate would be <strong>$381</strong>.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-two"><strong>Calculate how much your actual income exceeds the previous income limit in the table above.</strong> <br>If your actual income falls between income limits, this helps us adjust your rate to match your actual income. To calculate this amount, find the income limit in the row above your rounded-up limit and subtract it from your actual income.<br><br><strong>Using our example:</strong> $2,353 (actual income) - $2,300 (previous income limit) = <strong>$53</strong></li>
  <li class="process-step list-three"><strong>Multiply this amount by the rate of decrease (also called the $1 decrement).</strong> <br> This is the decimal listed to the right of your beginning monthly rate. It helps us adjust your rate to match your actual income level.<br><br><strong>Using our example:</strong> $53 X .05 (rate of decrease) = <strong>$2.65</strong></li>
  <li class="process-step list-four"><strong>Add this amount to your beginning monthly rate.</strong><br>This is your monthly payment. <br><br><strong>Using our example:</strong> $2.65 + $381 (beginning monthly rate) = <strong>$383.65</strong> monthly payment </li>
