## How to read the DIC for surviving parents rate charts

Each chart includes three columns. The first column shows a monthly income amount. To find your correct row, find the amount in the chart that’s the closest amount to your monthly income, rounded up to the nearest benefit level. 

For example, in Chart 3 below, if you make $1,353 a month, you would choose the row with **$1,400**, because your income is “equal to or less than” $1,400, but more than the previous level, $1,300. So $375 would be your beginning monthly rate.

But your income is less than $1,400, so you get a rate between the previous row’s rate of $378 and your beginning rate of $375. 

To find your actual monthly rate, you’ll use the “decrement” amount in the final column. The decrement is a decimal that’s multiplied to the difference between your monthly income and the income shown on the prior row.

This example shows how you’d use the decrement rate with the income and rate example above.

Start with your income, $1,353. Then subtract the previous row’s dollar amount. **$1,353 - $1,300 = $53**.

Then take that amount, $53, and multiply it by the decrement in Chart 3, .03. **$53 X .03 = $1.59**.

Then add that amount to your beginning monthly rate. **$375 + 1.59 = $376.39**.

Your new monthly rate would be **$376.59**.

| $1353</br>-1300</br>53</br></br>53</br>x.03</br>1.59</br></br>$375</br>+1.59</br>$376.59 | Your income</br>Minus prior row's limit</br>Difference</br></br>Difference</br>Times the decrement</br>Amount of extra monthly income</br></br>Your beginning monthly rate</br>Add your extra monthly income</br>Your new monthly rate |
