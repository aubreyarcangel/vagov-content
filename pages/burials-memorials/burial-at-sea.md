## Is burial at sea a Navy or National Cemetery Administration program?

The U.S. Navy provides burial at sea. The National Cemetery Administration can't provide this type of committal service. 

Learn more about [the Navy's burial at sea program](https://www.navy.mil/navydata/questions/burial.html).

For more information, call the U.S. Navy Mortuary Affairs office at <a href="tel:18667870081">866-787-0081</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET.

## Can I get a memorial item for a Veteran who has already been buried at sea? 

Yes. Active-duty service members and Veterans who were buried at sea may be eligible for a headstone or marker.
