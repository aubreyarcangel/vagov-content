[Find a national, state, or tribal government Veterans cemetery](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp)

Cemetery staff in national, military post, and military base cemeteries are responsible for setting the headstone or marker at no cost to you. Some state Veterans' cemeteries may charge you a nominal fee for setting a government headstone or marker.

## What if there's a mistake with the headstone inscription?

Contact the [national cemetery](https://www.cem.va.gov/cems/listcem.asp) where the grave is located. If the Veteran is buried in a private cemetery, you can get help by calling <a href="tel:+18006976947">800-697-6947</a>. 

## What do I need to know about burial in a private cemetery?

You may have additional costs, restrictions on the type of headstone or marker you can use, and other requirements you should know about when preparing for burial in a private cemetery. <br>
[Find out what to ask when planning a burial in a private cemetery](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/burial_benefits/private_cemetery.asp)

- You don't have to pay for the headstone or marker itself, but you're responsible for the cost of placing it (called a setting fee). And you'll need to make arrangements yourself to have the headstone or marker placed. 
- If you'd like, you can request a medallion to attach to a privately purchased headstone, marker, or niche cover in a private cemetery. You can choose from 3 different sizes. When you receive the medallion, it comes with a kit to help you attach it. <br>
