## What do I need to know about burial in a private cemetery?

**As you're preparing for the burial or memorial item, you should know that:**
- You don't have to pay for the headstone or marker itself, but you're responsible for the cost of placing it (called a setting fee). And you'll need to make arrangements yourself to have the headstone or marker placed. 
- If you'd like, you can request a medallion to attach to a privately purchased headstone, marker, or niche cover in a private cemetery. You can choose from 3 different sizes. When you receive the medallion, it comes with a kit to help you attach it. <br>
[Learn more about medallions and see what they look like](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/hmm/types.asp)
- You may have additional costs, restrictions on the type of headstone or marker you can use, and other requirements you should know about when preparing for burial in a private cemetery. <br>
