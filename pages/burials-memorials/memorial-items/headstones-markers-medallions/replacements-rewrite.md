## Under what circumstances will the government replace a headstone or marker?

**We will cover the cost of replacing a government-issued headstone or marker if it is:**

- Badly deteriorated
- Illegible
- Stolen
- Vandalized
- Inscribed incorrectly
- Damaged during shipping
- Not up to contract specifications

**We won't cover the cost of replacing a government-issued headstone or marker if:**

- The headstone or marker is located in a private cemetery and has been damaged by cemetery personnel. The cemetery is repsonsible for paying all replacement costs. 

## Will the replacement headstone or marker be the same style as the original?

Yes. If we replace a historic (greater than 50 years old) headstone or marker, we'll provide an item that has the same type and style as the original (sometimes called "replacing in kind"). 

## How do I request a replacement headstone or marker? 

Contact the Memorial Products Service Application Assistance Unit.



## What happens to headstones and markers after they're replaced? 

Marble and granite headstones or markers removed from a grave must be destroyed so that the inscription can no longer be read. Bronze markers must be returned to the contractor. 





Headstones and markers previously furnished by the Government may be replaced at Government expense if badly deteriorated, illegible, stolen or vandalized. We may also replace the new (or modern) headstone or marker if the inscription is incorrect, if it was damaged during shipping, or if the material or workmanship does not meet contract specifications. In cases where the primary-source documentation indicates that it is "more likely than not" that an existing inscription (e.g., name, date of birth, date of death, branch of service, etc.) on a historic headstone or marker (those greater than 50 years of age) is inaccurate, we will correct the inscription error and replace the marker "in kind," that is, with one that has the same type, style, and inscription elements that were used or available at the time of the decedent's death.

If a Government headstone or marker in a private cemetery is damaged by cemetery personnel, the cemetery should pay all replacement costs.

Marble and granite headstones or markers that are permanently removed from a grave must be destroyed, ensuring that the inscription is no longer legible. Bronze markers must be returned to the contractor.
