## Under what circumstances will the government replace a headstone or marker?

###### We'll cover the cost of replacing a government-issued headstone or marker if:

- Its condition has worsened over time 
- The inscription cannot be read
- The inscription is incorrect
- It has been stolen or vandalized
- It was damaged during shipping
- It doesn't meet the contract requirements

###### We won't cover the cost of replacing a government-issued headstone or marker if:

- The headstone or marker is located in a private cemetery and has been damaged by cemetery personnel. The cemetery is repsonsible for paying all replacement costs. 

## Will the replacement headstone or marker look the same as the original?

Yes. If we replace a historic (more than 50 years old) headstone or marker, we'll provide an item that has the same type and style as the original (sometimes called "replacing in kind"). 
  
## What happens to headstones and markers after they're replaced? 

If a marble or granite headstone or marker is removed from a grave, it must be destroyed so that the inscription can no longer be read. Bronze markers must be returned to the contractor.
