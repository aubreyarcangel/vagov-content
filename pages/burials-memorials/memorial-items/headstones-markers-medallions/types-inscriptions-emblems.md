### Medallions

#### What is a medallion?

A medallion is used to show that a gravesite or memorial site belongs to a Veteran. A medallion is an inscribed piece of bronze that can be attached to an existing, private purchased (non-VA) headstone or marker. 

#### Who gets a medallion?

Veterans who served on or after April 6, 1917 **and** who have graves in a private cemetery and a privately purchased headstone or marker. 

#### How do I get a medallion?



The Department of Veterans Affairs provides a medallion, by request, to be affixed to an existing, privately purchased headstone or marker to signify the deceased's status as a Veteran.

This device is furnished in lieu of a traditional Government headstone or grave marker for those Veterans who served on or after Apr. 6, 1917 and whose grave in a private cemetery is marked with a privately purchased headstone or marker.

Why choose a medallion: Bronze medallions are durable and can be easily affixed to privately purchased headstones by anyone, avoiding headstone or marker setting fees. The medallion also offers a way to identify the grave as that of a Veteran when a cemetery only allows one headstone per grave, preventing the use of a standard VA marker as a footstone.

Bronze Medallion Sizes: The medallion is available in three sizes: Large (6-3/8”W x 4-3/4”H x 1/2”D), Medium (3-3/4”W x 2-7/8”H x 1/4"D) and Small (2”W x 1-1/2”H x 1/3”D). Each medallion is inscribed with the word “VETERAN” across the top and the branch of service at the bottom.

Medal of Honor Medallion Sizes: The Medal of Honor (MOH) Medallion comes in Medium and Large. Each medallion is inscribed with "MEDAL OF HONOR" at the top and the branch of service at the bottom.

To request a medallion, please use VA Form 40-1330M, Claim for Government Medallion for Placement in a Private Cemetery. When requesting the MOH Medallion, check "OTHER" in block 11 and specify MOH.

Once a claim for a medallion is received and approved, VA will mail the medallion along with a kit that will allow the family or the staff of a private cemetery to affix the device to a headstone, grave marker, mausoleum or columbarium niche cover.

Important: This benefit is only applicable if the grave is marked with a privately purchased headstone or marker. In these instances, eligible Veterans are entitled to either a traditional Government-furnished headstone or marker, or the new medallion, but not both.

For family members of eligible Veterans interested in submitting a claim for the medallion, instructions on how to apply for a medallion are available. Please use: VA Form 40-1330M, Claim for Government Medallion for Placement in a Private Cemetery
