- **Weight:** About 230 pounds
- **Material:** Marble or granite
- **Color:** The stone color will vary. The marble may have light to medium veining (lines).

[See an example of an upright marble headstone](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/docs/factsheets/HeadstoneMarkerMedallion_Brochure.pdf)

**Note:** Civil War and Spanish American War Veterans who served in either Union or Confederate forces can get special headstones.

Fill out block 27 of the [Claim for Headstone or Marker application](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/va40-1330.pdf). 

### Markers

**A gravesite marker** is a piece of bronze, granite, or marble with an inscription that's placed flat on the ground at the gravesite. Gravesite markers are made of different materials and are different sizes. A marker's size depends on where it'll be placed. 

**A niche marker** is made of bronze and attaches to the wall of the columbarium where the Veteran's burial urn is located.

## Information about Medallions

A medallion is an inscribed piece of bronze that can be attached to an existing, privately purchased headstone or marker. A medallion shows that a gravesite or memorial site belongs to a Veteran. 

### What does a medallion look like?

[See an example of a medallion](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/docs/factsheets/Bronze_MOH_Medallion.pdf)

Medallions are: 

- Easy to attach to different kinds of headstones and markers

- A way to show Veteran status in a private cemetery

Medallions are for Veterans who: 
- Served on or after April 6, 1917, **and** 
- Have a grave in a private cemetery and a privately purchased headstone or marker can get a medallion

### How do I apply for a Civil War and Spanish-American War headstone? 

To apply for a headstone or marker in a historical style, you'll need to show proof of the Veteran's military service. 

**To show proof of pre-World War I military service, you'll need to provide this information in your headstone or marker claim:**

- Detailed primary documentation. Primary documentation may include Compiled Military Service Records (CMSR), details from official State files, Federal pension documents, or land warrants. 

###### If you don't have detailed primary documentation, you can request it through National Archives and Records Administration (NARA):

[Follow the instructions on the NARA website to order pre-World War I records.](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/pre-ww-1-records) Copies of CMSRs, Federal pension records, and other primary documentation can be ordered through NARA. <br>

The fee for requesting records is between $25 and $75. Records ship 60-90 days from the date of your request.
