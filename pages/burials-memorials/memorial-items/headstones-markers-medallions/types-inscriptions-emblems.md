### Medallions

#### What is a medallion?

A medallion is an inscribed piece of bronze that can be attached to an existing, private purchased (non-VA) headstone or marker. A medallion shows that a gravesite or memorial site belongs to a Veteran. 

#### Why should I choose a medallion?

If you have a privately purchased headstone or marker, a medallion is a good way to show Vetearn status. 

Medallions are: 

- Easy to attach to different kinds of headstones and markers
- Free--there are no headstone or marker setting fees
- Long-lasting and durable
- A way to show Veteran status in a private cemetery that may have rules against the types of markers, headstones, or footstones you can use


#### Who can get a medallion? How can I get a medallion?

Medallions are for Veterans who: 
- Served on or after April 6, 1917, **and** 
- Have a grave in a private cemetery and a privately purchased headstone or marker can get a medallion
**Note:** If you're eligible for both a VA headstone and a medallion, you may only choose one.
