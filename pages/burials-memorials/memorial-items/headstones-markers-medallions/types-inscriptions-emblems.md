## Medallions

### What is a medallion? 

A medallion is an inscribed piece of bronze that can be attached to an existing, private purchased (non-VA) headstone or marker. A medallion shows that a gravesite or memorial site belongs to a Veteran. 

[See an example of a medallion.](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/docs/factsheets/Bronze_MOH_Medallion.pdf)

Medallions are: 

- Easy to attach to different kinds of headstones and markers
- Free. There are no headstone or marker setting fees.
- Long-lasting and durable
- A way to show Veteran status in a private cemetery


### Who can get a medallion? 

Medallions are for Veterans who: 
- Served on or after April 6, 1917, **and** 
- Have a grave in a private cemetery and a privately purchased headstone or marker can get a medallion

**Note:** If you're eligible for both a VA headstone and a medallion, you may only choose one.
