### Medallions

#### What is a medallion?

A medallion is an inscribed piece of bronze that can be attached to an existing, private purchased (non-VA) headstone or marker. A medallion shows that a gravesite or memorial site belongs to a Veteran. 

#### Why should I choose a medallion?

If you have a privately purchased headstone or marker, a medallion is a good way to show Vetearn status. 

Medallions are: 

- Easy to attach to different kinds of headstones and markers
- Free--there are no headstone or marker setting fees
- Long-lasting and durable
- A way to show Veteran status in a private cemetery that may have rules against the types of markers, headstones, or footstones you can use


#### Who are medallions for? How can I get a medallion?

Veterans who served on or after April 6, 1917 **and** who have graves in a private cemetery and a privately purchased headstone or marker can get a medallion.

[Find out if you're eligible for a medallion, and learn how to apply.](/burials-memorials/memorial-items/headstones-markers-medallions/)


#### What types of medallions are available?

##### Bronze medallions





Bronze Medallion Sizes: The medallion is available in three sizes: Large (6-3/8”W x 4-3/4”H x 1/2”D), Medium (3-3/4”W x 2-7/8”H x 1/4"D) and Small (2”W x 1-1/2”H x 1/3”D). Each medallion is inscribed with the word “VETERAN” across the top and the branch of service at the bottom.

Medal of Honor Medallion Sizes: The Medal of Honor (MOH) Medallion comes in Medium and Large. Each medallion is inscribed with "MEDAL OF HONOR" at the top and the branch of service at the bottom.

To request a medallion, please use VA Form 40-1330M, Claim for Government Medallion for Placement in a Private Cemetery. When requesting the MOH Medallion, check "OTHER" in block 11 and specify MOH.

Once a claim for a medallion is received and approved, VA will mail the medallion along with a kit that will allow the family or the staff of a private cemetery to affix the device to a headstone, grave marker, mausoleum or columbarium niche cover.

Important: This benefit is only applicable if the grave is marked with a privately purchased headstone or marker. In these instances, eligible Veterans are entitled to either a traditional Government-furnished headstone or marker, or the new medallion, but not both.

For family members of eligible Veterans interested in submitting a claim for the medallion, instructions on how to apply for a medallion are available. Please use: VA Form 40-1330M, Claim for Government Medallion for Placement in a Private Cemetery
