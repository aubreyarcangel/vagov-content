## What happens during a committal service for a Veteran or service member?

When you arrive at the cemetery, a cemetery representative will meet you and give you the deceased’s burial documents. They'll lead you, and others who are gathered to honor the deceased, to a committal shelter. The committal service takes place at this location, not at the gravesite, and lasts for about 20 minutes. The burial happens after the committal service.<br>

**Note:** Please be aware that viewing facilities aren't available at national cemeteries, and the family must arrange for funeral services at a different location. 

The family may choose to have readings by a friend or family member. They may also request to have [military funeral honors](https://www.cem.va.gov/CEM/military_funeral_honors.asp) performed at the committal shelter. Arrange for military funeral honors through your funeral director or get help from a Veterans Service Organization or VA national cemetery staff.

**Military funeral honors include:**
- The playing of “Taps”
- A rifle detail
- A color guard
- Uniformed service members who present the burial flag

**Note:** If you requested a headstone, marker, or medallion, we’ll arrange for it to be delivered within 60 days. <br>

## How can I pay my respects at a committal service?

**You may:** 
- Bring flowers to accompany the casket or urn when it's taken from the committal shelter to the gravesite, **and**
- Visit the gravesite at the end of the workday, but not immediately following the ceremony
