## What happens during a commital service for a Veteran or service member?

When you arrive at the cemetery, a cemetery representative will meet you and provide you with the deceased’s burial documents. They'll lead you and others gathered to honor the deceased to a committal shelter. The service takes place at this location, not at the gravesite. Viewing facilities aren't available and funeral services cannot be held at VA national cemeteries,There may be readings or military honors, led by someone of the family's choice. 

The family may choose to have military funeral honors.

**Military funeral honors include:**
- The playing of “Taps”
- A rifle detail
- A color guard
- Uniformed service members who present the burial flag
