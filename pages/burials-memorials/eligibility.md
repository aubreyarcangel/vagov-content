If you qualify for burial in a VA national cemetery, you'll receive burial benefits at no cost to your family. 

**Burial benefits include:**
- Opening and closing of the grave
- A burial liner provided by the government
- A headstone or marker provided by the government
- Perpetual (ongoing) care of the gravesite

At the time of need, the person planning the burial can also request other honors and memorial items.

## If I'm the survivor of a Veteran or Servicemember, what other benefits can I get?

We give the surviving spouse, children, and parents of Veterans and Servicemembers a range of benefits. These may include tax-free monetary benefits (called Dependency and Indemnity Compensation) and help paying for the funeral service (called a burial allowance). <br>

## Can I plan ahead for my burial in a VA national cemetery?

Yes. You can plan ahead to make the process of applying for a burial in a VA national cemetery easier for your family members in the event of your death. To do this, you’ll need to apply for a pre-need eligibility determination. <br>

[Find out how to apply](/burials-memorials/pre-need-eligibility/).

 **Please note:** The pre-need eligibility determination is only for national cemeteries. If you want to be buried in a state or tribal Veterans cemetery, check the site you want ahead of time, since some state Veterans cemeteries require that you live in that state or have other rules around eligibility.<br>
 [Find a state Veterans cemetery](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp).
 
## How can I make sure my family members have all the information and documents they need to plan for the future?
Our Survivors and Burial Benefits Kit can guide you and your family members through the planning process so they have what they need to prepare for the future and get the benefits they're entitled to. This kit, called "Planning Your Legacy," includes:
- Information about survivors’ benefits
- Sample forms you and your family members may need to fill out
- A section where you can record the personal information your family members will need and the location of important documents, like your birth certificate or will
