## More about VA burial benefits and planning

### What does burial in a VA national cemetery include?

When a Veteran, service member, or family member qualifies for burial in a VA national cemetery, they receive certain burial benefits at no cost to their family.

**These burial benefits include:**
- A gravesite in any of our [136 national cemeteries](/find-locations/?zoomLevel=4&page=1&address=&facilityType=cemetery&serviceType) with available space
- Opening and closing of the grave
- A burial liner provided by the government
- [A headstone or marker provided by the government](/burials-memorials/memorial-items/headstones-markers-medallions/)
- Perpetual (ongoing) care of the gravesite

At the time of need, the person planning the burial can also request other [VA memorial items](/burials-memorials/memorial-items/) as well as [military funeral honors](https://www.cem.va.gov/CEM/military_funeral_honors.asp) provided by the Department of Defense. These items and honors have other eligibility requirements.

### Can I plan ahead for my burial in a VA national cemetery?

Yes. You can plan ahead to make the process of applying for a burial in a VA national cemetery easier for your family members in the event of your death. To do this, you’ll need to [apply for a pre-need eligibility determination](/burials-memorials/pre-need-eligibility/).

 **Please note:** The pre-need eligibility determination is only for VA national cemeteries. If you want to be buried in a [state or tribal Veterans cemetery](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/cems/listcem.asp), check the site you want ahead of time, since some state Veterans cemeteries require that you live in that state or have other rules around eligibility.<br>
  
### How can I make sure my family members have all the information and documents they need to plan for the future?
Our Survivors and Burial Benefits Kit can guide you and your family members through the planning process so they have what they need to prepare for the future and get the benefits they're entitled to. This kit, called "Planning Your Legacy," includes:
- Information about survivors’ benefits
- Sample forms you and your family members may need to fill out
- A section where you can record the personal information your family members will need and the location of important documents, like your birth certificate or will

 [Download the VA Survivors and Burial Benefits Kit (PDF)](https://www.cem.va.gov/cem/docs/factsheets/Planning_Legacy_Booklet.pdf)
 
 **Note:** If you decide not to use this Burial Benefits Kit, make sure your family knows your final wishes for burial and memorial honors and the location of your discharge papers to establish eligibility.

### What should I do if I received an honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge?

If you've received one of these discharge statuses, you may not be eligible for VA benefits.
