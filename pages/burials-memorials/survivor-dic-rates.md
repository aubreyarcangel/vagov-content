## Rates if the Veteran died on or after January 1, 1993 
**Effective December 1, 2018**

To find your total monthly payment amount, start with the **Basic monthly payment rates** table below. Find the survivor status that applies to you.

- **If you're the surviving dependent child of a Veteran, and the Veteran has no surviving spouse,** the rate listed to the right is your total monthly payment.
- **If you're the surviving spouse of a Veteran,** the rate listed to the right is your basic monthly payment. You may also be eligible for added amounts based on certain factors. Go to the **Added amounts** table next to find any descriptions that are true for you. Add the amount listed to the right of each description to your basic monthly payment. This is your total monthly payment.

### Basic monthly payment rates

All rates in $ U.S. dollars
| **Survivor status** | **Monthly payment** | 
|---|---| 
| Surviving dependent child of a Veteran, when the Veteran has no surviving spouse | 452.00 |
| Surviving spouse | 1,319.04 |

### Added amounts for surviving spouses

All rates in $ U.S. dollars
| If this description is true... | You may qualify for this benefit | Added monthly amount | 
| ---| --- | --- | 
| <ul><li>The Veteran had a VA service-connected disability rating of totally disabling (including for individual unemployability) for at least the 8 full years leading up to their death, **and**</li><li>You were married to the Veteran for those same 8 years</li></ul> | 8-year provision | 280.09 |
| You have a disability and need help with regular daily activities (like eating, bathing, or dressing) | Aid and Attendance | 236.77 |
| You can't leave your house due to a disability | Housebound allowance | 153.08 |
| You have 1 or more children who are under age 18 | <ul><li>Transitional benefit, **and**</li><li>DIC apportionment rate</li></ul> | <ul><li>282.00 <br> for the first 2 years after the Veteran's death</li><li>326.77 <br> for each eligible child</li></ul>

### Example of how to use these tables to figure out your monthly payment

If you were the surviving spouse of a Veteran, **and** you had 2 children under age 18, **and** you qualified for both the 8-year provision and Aid and Attendance, you would figure out your rate as you see below.

#### Total monthly payment for the first 2 years

$1,319.04 (basic monthly rate) <br> + $326.77 (1st child under 18) <br> + $326.77 (2nd child under age 18) <br> + $280.09 (8-year provision) <br> + $236.77 (Aid and Attendance) <br> + $282.00 (transitional benefit) <br> = **$2,771.44**

#### Total monthly payment after 2 years (when transitional benefit ends)

$2,771.44 (monthly payment with transitional benefit) <br>  - $282.00 (transitional benefit) <br> = **$2,489.44**

## Rates if the Veteran died before January 1, 1993 
**Effective December 1, 2018**

If your Veteran spouse or parent died before January 1, 1993, we use a different method to determine your DIC monthly payment.

### Surviving spouse, with or without dependent children

To find your monthly payment, click on the Veteran's pay grade category. Find their specific pay grade in the left column of the **Basic monthly payment rates** table, and the matching monthly payment to the right. 

Then, go down to the **Added or increased amounts** table. Add any added or increased amounts that apply to you based on the Veteran's disability rating and whether you have dependent children under age 18.

## How your payments for DIC may affect your VA Survivors Pension or Survivor Benefit Plan 

### How do my payments for DIC affect my ability to receive a VA Survivors Pension?

If we determine that you're eligible for both DIC and [Survivors Pension benefits](/pension/survivors-pension/), we'll pay you whichever benefit gives you the most money. <br>
[View current VA Survivors Pension benefit rates](/pension/survivors-pension-rates/)

### What's a Survivor Benefit Plan?

The Survivor Benefit Program is a voluntary annuity program that service members may purchase as a retirement benefit for their family members. An annuity is a monthly payment received for life. Depending on their military service, members may buy a Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) or Reserve Component Survivor Benefit Plan (RCSBP).

We don't manage this program. It's managed by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at the Department of Defense. 

### Can I receive SBP or RCSBP payments and DIC at the same time?

In most cases, you can't receive a full SBP or RCSBP payment and a full DIC payment at the same time. 

**Exception:** If you're receiving an SBP or RCSBP annuity from one spouse, but then remarry after age 57 and become eligible for DIC based on the service-connected disability of another spouse, you can receive full benefits through both programs at the same time. 

### What happens if I'm receiving SBP or RCSBP payments and then qualify for DIC—but the exception above doesn't apply to me?

DFAS will reduce your SBP or RCSBP by the amount of your DIC payment. If your DIC payment is greater than your total SBP or RCSBP payment, DFAS will stop your SBP or RCSBP payments. This is called the "SBP/DIC offset."

If DFAS pays you more than the offset amount in SBP or RCSBP payments after you begin receiving DIC payments, they'll consider this amount an overpayment. This means you'll have to pay the money back.

Be sure to notify DFAS as soon as you qualify for DIC so they can reduce your SBP or RCSBP payment amount and you can avoid owing money. You'll need to send them a copy of your VA DIC award letter. You can call DFAS at <a href="tel:+18003211080">800-321-1080</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET.
