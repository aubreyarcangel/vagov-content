## If the Veteran’s death was on or after January 1, 1993 

### Basic monthly DIC rate

The basic monthly rate for these surviving spouses and dependents is **$1,319.04**. The relevant law is 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(1). In addition to this basic amount, you may qualify for additional money under the “additional allowances” listed below.

### Additional allowances you may be able to get

You may be able to get additional benefits on top of the basic monthly amount. Here are additional benefits you may qualify for.

#### Benefits for Veteran service-related disability

You may qualify for additional payments if you’re the surviving spouse of a Veteran who had a specific kind of disability before their death. This program is also called the “8-year provision.” You may be eligible if **both** of the following things are true. The Veteran:

- Was receiving, or was eligible to receive, compensation for a service-connected disability rated **totally disabling**, including a rating based on individual unemployability, for at least 8 continuous years immediately before their death, **and**

- Was married to you, the surviving spouse, for those same 8 years. 

Additional amount available: **$280.09**

Relevant law: 38 U.S.C. 1311(a)(2) 

#### Benefits for spouse needing Aid and Attendance (A&A)

If you’re the surviving spouse and you need help doing daily activities, you may qualify for the A&A benefit. 

Additional amount available: **$326.77**</br>
Relevant law: 38 U.S.C. 1311(c)

#### Benefits for spouse needing housebound compensation

If you’re the surviving spouse and are housebound, you may qualify for this benefit.

Additional amount available: **$153.08**</br>
Relevant law: 38 U.S.C. 1311(d)

#### Benefits for spouse with one or more children under age 18

If you have 1 or more children, you may qualify for 2 different additional amounts. The first, called the transitional benefit, is for any spouse with children under age 18.

Additional amount available: **$282.00 for 2 years**</br>
Relevant law: 38 U.S.C. 1311(f)(4)

In addition, you can add another allowance for each child under age 18. These DIC apportionment rates, approved by the Under Secretary for Benefits under 38 CFR 3.461(b), will be the additional allowance for each child.

Additional amount available: **$326.77 per child**</br>
Relevant law: 38 U.S.C. 1311(b)

#### Benefits for children without a surviving spouse of a Veteran

Children of Veterans who had no surviving spouse can receive their own benefit payments.

Additional amount available: **$452.00**

### Example: How to find your total benefit amount

In this example, the surviving spouse has 2 children, and is the survivor of a Veteran who was covered under the 8-year provision. The monthly rate for the surviving spouse increases from the basic rate of $1,154 to a new monthly rate of $1,972.

| **Rates** | **Amounts** |
|---|---:|
| Basic rate</br>1st child</br>2nd child</br>8-year provision</br>Total | $1,154</br>286</br>286</br>+ 246</br>$1,972 |

## If the Veteran’s death was before January 1, 1993

The Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) benefits paid to survivors of Veterans who died before January 1, 1993, can seem complex. The rate is based on the highest pay grade that the Veteran held for 6 months of active duty. We decided rates for children on several factors:

-	The Veteran’s pay grade
-	Whether the surviving spouse was entitled to benefits
-	Whether the child was sharing benefits with other children

There are 5 rate tables for this benefit. They include:

-	Surviving spouse, enlisted pay grade
-	Surviving spouse, warrant officer pay grade
-	Surviving spouse, officer pay grade
-	Children, with the Veteran’s surviving spouse also due benefits
-	Children, with no surviving spouse of the Veteran

Below you’ll find the rates for each of these groups of survivors and dependents.
