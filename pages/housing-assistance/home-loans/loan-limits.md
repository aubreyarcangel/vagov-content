## About VA home limits

### What’s a VA home loan limit? 

A VA home loan limit is the maximum amount of money that we will cover you can borrow with a VA-backed or VA direct home loan, without making a down payment.

This doesn't mean you can't borrow more than the limit. We don't put a limit on how much money you can borrow to finance your home. But your lender may use the loan limit to help determine how much they're willing to let you borrow.

### What will my limit be? 

Your VA home loan limit will depend on your military service history and the location of the home you're buying or refinancing. Loan limits vary by county because a property's location affects its value. For example, the same home in or near a major city will likely cost much more than it would in a more rural location.

If you’re eligible for the VA home loan program, we'll guarantee to your lender that we'll pay up to $36,000 or 25% of your loan amount, whichever is less, if you default on your loan. We refer to this amount as your basic entitlement. In most cases, lenders will loan up to 4 times the amount of your entitlement without a down payment (so in this case, $144,000), as long as you're income and credit qualified and the property’s value matches its asking price. 

In many cases, you may want to buy a home that costs more than $144,000. To help you do this, we offer what's called bonus entitlement. To determine your bonus entitlement, we'll look at the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA's) current national conventional financing confirming limit and your state's county loan limits. We'll guarantee 25% of your loan amount, based on these loan limits.
