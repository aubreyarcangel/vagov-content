## About VA home limits

### What’s a VA home loan limit? 

A VA home loan limit is the maximum amount of money that you may be able to borrow using a VA-backed home loan, without paying a portion of the home's total sale price up front (called a down payment). 

This doesn't mean you can't borrow more than the limit. We don't put a limit on how much money you can borrow to finance your home. But we do limit the amount that we'll guarantee your lender we'll cover if you default on your loan. And your lender may use this information to help determine how much they're willing to let you borrow. 

### What will my loan limit be? 

Your limit will depend on your [VA home loan program eligibility](/housing-assistance/home-loans/eligibility/) and the location of the home you're buying or refinancing. Loan limits vary by county because a property's location affects its value. For example, the same home in or near a major city will likely cost much more than it would in a more rural location.

#### Here's how it works

If you’re eligible for the VA home loan program, you'll get what we call an entitlement. This is the maximum amount of money we'll guarantee to your lender that we'll pay if you default on your loan. In most cases, as long as you qualify for the loan based on your income and credit history, and the property’s value matches its asking price, lenders will loan up to 4 times the amount of your entitlement without a down payment.

**You may qualify for 2 types of entitlement:**

- **Basic entitlement:** As your basic entitlement, we'll guarantee to your lender that we'll pay up to at least $36,000 or 25% of your loan amount, whichever is less, if you default on your loan. So your loan limit would be $36,000 X 4 = **$144,000**.

- **Bonus (or Tier-2) entitlement:** In many cases, you may want to buy a home that costs more than $144,000. To help you do this, we offer what's called bonus entitlement. To determine your bonus entitlement, we'll look at the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA's) current national conventional financing confirming limit and your state's county loan limits. We'll guarantee 25% of your loan amount, based on these loan limits. 

If you have questions about your entitlement, talk to your lender or call us at 877-827-3702 to find the nearest VA regional office with loan guaranty staff. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET.

### What if I don't use all of my entitlement on my first home loan?

If you don't use all of your entitlement on your first home loan, you'll have what's called “remaining entitlement.” You can use this remaining amount, either on its own or in combination with a down payment, to take out another home loan in the future.
