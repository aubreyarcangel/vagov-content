## About VA home limits

### What’s a VA home loan limit? 

A VA home loan limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow using a VA-backed home loan, without paying a portion of the home's total sale price up front (called a down payment). It's not a cap on the maximum amount you can borrow. 

**Here's how it works:**

If you qualify for a VA-backed home loan, you'll receive a home loan entitlement. This is the maximum amount we'll guarantee the lender that we'll pay if you default on your loan. 

As long as you qualify for a loan based on your income and credit history, and the property’s value matches its asking price, your lender will likely agree to loan you up to 4 times the amount of your entitlement without a down payment. This is your loan limit. 

You may still be able to borrow more than this amount if you're able and willing to pay a down payment. Most lenders require that your entitlement, down payment, or a combination of both cover at least 25% of your total loan amount.

### What will my loan limit be? 

This will depend on your entitlement, and on the location of the property for which you want the loan. Loan limits vary by county because a property's location affects its value. For example, the same home in or near a major city will likely cost much more than it would in a more rural location. 

**You may qualify for 2 types of entitlement:**

- **Basic entitlement:** As your basic entitlement, we'll guarantee to your lender that we'll pay up to at least $36,000 or 25% of your loan amount, whichever is less, if you default on your loan. So your loan limit would be $36,000 X 4 = **$144,000**. 

- **Bonus entitlement:** You may want to buy a home that costs more than $144,000. To help you do this, we offer what's called bonus (or Tier 2) entitlement. To determine your bonus entitlement, we'll look at the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (FHFA's) current national conventional financing confirming limit and your state's county loan limits. We'll guarantee 25% of your loan amount, based on these loan limits. 

If you have questions about your entitlement, talk to your lender or call us at <a href="tel:+18778273702">877-827-3702</a> to find the nearest VA regional loan center. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET.

### What if I don't use all of my entitlement on my first home loan?

You'll have what's called “remaining entitlement.” You can use this remaining amount, either on its own or in combination with a down payment, to take out another home loan in the future.
