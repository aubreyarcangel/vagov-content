## What’s a VA home loan limit? 

A VA home loan limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow without making a downpayment. 

## How is my VA home loan limit determined? 

VA home loan limits depend on your military service and the county the home is in. Loan limits vary by county because a property's location affects its value. 

If you’re eligible for this benefit, you’re entitled to borrow at least $36,000.00. In most cases, lenders will loan up to 4x your entitlement amount without a down payment, as long as you're income and credit qualified and the property’s value matches its asking price. <br>


## VA home loan limits by year and county

VA home loan limits change each year and are based on the property's county location. Find the VA home loan limit for the county your property (or future property) is in.
