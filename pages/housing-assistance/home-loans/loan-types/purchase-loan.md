## Why might I want a VA-backed purchase loan?

### A VA-backed purchase loan often offers:

- **No down payment** as long as the sales price isn’t higher than the home’s appraised value (the value set for the home after an expert reviews the property)
- **Better terms and interest rates** than other loans from private banks, mortgage companies, or credit unions (also called lenders)
- **The ability to borrow up to the FannieMae/FreddieMac conforming loan limit** on a no-down-payment loan in most areas—and more in some high-cost counties. You can borrow more than this amount if you want to make a down payment. <br>

- **No need for private mortgage insurance (PMI) or mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)**
  - PMI is a type of insurance that protects the lender if you end up not being able to pay your mortgage. It’s usually required on conventional loans if you make a down payment of less than 20% of the total mortgage amount.
  - MIP is what the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires you to pay to self-insure an FHA loan against future loss.
- **Fewer closing costs**, which may be paid by the seller
- **No penalty fee** if you pay the loan off early

### If you qualify for a VA-backed purchase loan, you can use the loan to:

-	Buy a single-family home, up to 4 units
- Buy a condo in a VA-approved project
-	Buy a home and improve it
-	Buy a manufactured home or lot
-	Build a new home
-	Make changes or add new features (like solar power) to make your home more energy efficient

### You can also:

- Get a VA-backed home loan to buy your first home
- Use your VA loan benefit again if you sell or refinance a home you bought with a VA-backed home loan
- Assume a VA-backed home loan (which means that instead of opening a new mortgage loan, the buyer takes over the seller’s loan)
