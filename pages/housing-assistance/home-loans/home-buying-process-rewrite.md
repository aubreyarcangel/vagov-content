## Why might I want a VA-backed home loan?

### A VA-backed home loan often offers:

- **No down payment** as long as the sales price isn’t higher than the home’s appraised value (the value set for the home after an expert reviews the property)
- **Better terms and interest rates** than other loans from private banks, mortgage companies, or credit unions (also called lenders)
- **VA assistance if you temporarily can't make payments
- **No need for private mortgage insurance (PMI) or mortgage insurance premiums (MIP)**
  - PMI is a type of insurance that protects the lender if you end up not being able to pay your mortgage. It’s usually required on conventional loans if you make a down payment of less than 20% of the total mortgage amount.
  - MIP is what the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires you to pay to self-insure an FHA loan against future loss.
- **Fewer closing costs**, which may be paid by the seller
- **No penalty fee** if you pay the loan off early

### You can also:

- Use a VA-backed home loan even if you're not a first-time home buyer
- Reuse this benefit

<b>Note:</b> VA-backed home loans are "assumable," which means that the loan can be transferred from you to someone who buys your home in the future.

### If you qualify for a VA-backed home loan, you can use the loan to:

-	Buy a home or residential condo
- Build a home
-	Buy a home and improve it
-	Buy a manufactured home or lot
-	Make changes or add new features (like solar power) to make your home more energy efficient
- Refinance an existing non-VA loan
- Reinance an existing VA loan to lower the interest rate
