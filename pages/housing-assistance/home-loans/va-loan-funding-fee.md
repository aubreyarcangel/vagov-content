Learn about the VA funding fee and other closing costs you may need to pay on your VA-backed or VA direct home loan.

<h2>What is the VA funding fee?</h2>

The VA funding fee is a one-time payment that the buyer pays on a VA-backed or VA direct home loan. This fee helps to lower the cost of the loan for U.S. taxpayers since the VA home loan program doesn't require down payments or monthly mortgage insurance.

<h2>Will I have to pay the VA funding fee?</h2>

If you're using a VA home loan to buy, build, improve, or repair a home or to refinance a mortgage, you'll need to pay the VA funding fee unless you meet certain requirements.

<strong>You won’t have to pay a VA funding fee if any of the below descriptions is true for you. You're:</strong>
- Receiving VA compensation for a service-connected disability, <strong>or</strong>
- Eligible to receive VA compensation for a service-connected disability, but you're receiving retirement or active-duty pay instead, <strong>or</strong>
- The surviving spouse of a Veteran who died in service or from a service-connected disability

<h2>How will I pay this fee?</h2>

You'll pay this fee when you close your VA-backed or VA direct home loan. 

<strong>You can pay the VA funding fee in either of these ways</strong>: 

- Include the funding fee in your loan and pay it off over time (called financing), <strong>or</strong> 
- Pay the full fee all at once at closing

<h2>How will VA determine my funding fee?</h2>

**For all loans, we'll base your fee on:** 

- The type of loan you get, **and**
- The total amount of your loan. We calculate your funding fee as a percentage of your total loan amount.

**Depending on your loan type, we may also base your fee on:**
- Your military category, **and**
- Whether it’s your first time getting a VA-backed or VA direct home loan, **and**
- Your down payment amount

**Note:** Your lender will also charge interest on the loan in addition to closing fees. Please be sure to talk to your lender about any loan costs that may be added to your loan amount.
