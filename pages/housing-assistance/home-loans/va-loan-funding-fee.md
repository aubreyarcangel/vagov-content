<h2>Do I have to pay a VA funding fee?</h2>

Most Veterans have to pay a VA funding fee when getting a VA-backed or VA direct home loan. 

<strong>You don’t have to pay a VA funding fee if you</strong>: 
- Have a service-connected disability and receive VA disability compensation 
- Have a service-connected disability and are eligible for VA disability compensation, and have not received retirement or active duty pay
- Are a surviving spouse of a Veteran who died in service or from a service-connected disability

<h2>How does a VA funding fee work?</h2>

You must pay a VA funding fee when you close your VA-backed or VA direct home loan. 

<strong>You can pay the VA funding fee in 2 ways</strong>: 

- Include the funding fee in your loan and pay it off over time 
- Pay the fee upfront 


<h2>How is my VA funding fee determined?</h2>

A VA funding fee is a percentage of your total loan amount. 

**Your funding fee is based on:** 

- The type of loan you get
- Your down payment amount
- Your military category
- Whether it’s your first time getting a VA-backed or VA direct home loan

<h2>Loan closing costs</h2>

Your home loan lender--not VA--determines these details of your loan:

- Interest rate
- Discount points
- Closing costs


You (the purchaser), the seller, or both parties <strong>can pay</strong> these closing costs: 

- VA appraisal
- Credit report
- State and local taxes
- Recording fees

Sellers must pay some closing closing costs (sometimes called “seller’s concessions”). You (the purchaser) <strong>can’t pay</strong> these closing costs:

- Commission
- Brokerage fee
- Buyer broker fee
- Termite report (unless your loan is a refinance loan)

In most cases, sellers shouldn’t pay more than 4% of the total home loan in closing costs.
