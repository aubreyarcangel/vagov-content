<h2>Will I have to pay a VA funding fee?</h2>

If you're using a VA home loan to purchase a home or refinance a mortgage, you'll need to pay a funding fee. A VA funding fee is a percentage of your total loan amount. 

<strong>You won’t have to pay a VA funding fee if any of the below descriptions is true for you. You're:</strong>
- Receiving VA compensation for a service-connected disability, <strong>or</strong>
- Eligible to receive VA compensation for a service-connected disability, but you're receiving retirement or active-duty pay instead, <strong>or</strong>
- The surviving spouse of a Veteran who died in service or from a service-connected disability

<h2>How will I pay the VA funding fee for my loan?</h2>

You'll pay this fee when you close your VA-backed or VA direct home loan. 

<strong>You can pay the VA funding fee in either of these ways</strong>: 

- Include the funding fee in your loan and pay it off over time, <strong>or</strong 
- Pay the fee upfront 


<h2>How will VA determine my funding fee?</h2>

**We'll base your fee on:** 

- The type of loan you get, <strong>and</strong>
- Your down payment amount, <strong>and</strong>
- Your military category, <strong>and</strong>
- Whether it’s your first time getting a VA-backed or VA direct home loan

<strong>Note:</strong> Your lender will also charge interest on the loan in addition to closing fees. Please be sure to talk to your lender about any loan costs that may be added to your loan amount.
