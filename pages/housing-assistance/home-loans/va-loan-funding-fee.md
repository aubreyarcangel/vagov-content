<h2>Do I have to pay a VA funding fee?</h2>

Most Veterans have to pay a VA funding fee when getting a VA-backed or VA direct home loan. 

<strong>You don’t have to pay a VA funding fee if you</strong>: 
- Have a service-connected disability and receive VA disability compensation 
- Have a service-connected disability and are eligible for VA disability compensation, and have not received retirement or active duty pay
- Are a surviving spouse of a Veteran who died in service or from a service-connected disability

<h2>How does a VA funding fee work?</h2>

You must pay a VA funding fee when you close your VA-backed or VA direct home loan. 

<strong>You can pay the VA funding fee in 2 ways</strong>: 

- Include the funding fee in your loan and pay it off over time 
- Pay the fee upfront 


<h2>How is my VA funding fee determined?</h2>

A VA funding fee is a percentage of your total loan amount. 

**Your funding fee is based on:** 

- The type of loan you get
- Your down payment amount
- Your military category
- Whether it’s your first time getting a VA-backed or VA direct home loan
