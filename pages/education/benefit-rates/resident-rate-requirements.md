When you use your Post-9/11 GI Bill or Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty benefits for school, your school must charge you only
in-state tuition and fee rates. This law applies to all institutions of higher learning (IHL), like colleges and universities,
for terms that began after July 1, 2017. Your IHL, must do this for all “covered individuals.”

## How do I know whether I’m a covered individual?

You’re a covered individual, and your school must charge you only in-state rates for tuition and fees, if you are any **one**
of the following. You:
-	Live in the state where your school is located (regardless of your formal state of residence), and you enroll in the school
within 3 years of discharge from active-duty service of 90 days or more, **or**
-	Are using transferred benefits and you live in the state where the school is located (regardless of your formal state of
residence), and you enroll in the school within 3 years of discharge from active-duty service of 90 days or more, **or**
- Are in one of the two groups above, and have stayed continuously enrolled at the same school. You must have enrolled in the
school before the end of the 3-year period after your discharge, and you must be getting educational benefits under either the
Post-9/11 GI Bill or the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty program chapter 30 or chapter 33, of title 38, United States Code,
**or**
-	Are using transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and live in the state where the school is located and you’re  a member of
the uniformed service who’s serving on active duty.
