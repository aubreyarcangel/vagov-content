When you use your Post-9/11 GI Bill or Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty benefits for school, your school must charge you only
in-state tuition and fee rates. This law applies to all institutions of higher learning (IHL), like colleges and universities,
for terms that began after July 1, 2017. Your IHL must do this for all “covered individuals.”

## How do I know whether I’m a covered individual?

You’re a covered individual, and your school must charge you only in-state rates for tuition and fees, if you are any **one**
of the following. You:
-	Live in the state where your school is located (regardless of your formal state of residence), and you enroll in the school
within 3 years of discharge from active-duty service of 90 days or more, **or**
-	Are using transferred benefits and you live in the state where the school is located (regardless of your formal state of
residence), and you enroll in the school within 3 years of discharge from active-duty service of 90 days or more, **or**
- Are in one of the two groups above, and have stayed continuously enrolled at the same school. You must have enrolled in the
school before the end of the 3-year period after your discharge, and you must be getting educational benefits under either the
Post-9/11 GI Bill or the Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty program chapter 30 or chapter 33, of title 38, United States Code,
**or**
-	Are using transferred Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and live in the state where the school is located and you’re  a member of
the uniformed service who’s serving on active duty.
-	Are using benefits under the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship and live in the state where the school is 
located (regardless of your formal state of residence)

## I’m on active duty. Does the in-state rate apply to me?

No, the in-state provisions don’t apply if you’re still on active duty.

## I’m a covered individual, but my school isn’t offering me in-state tuition and fees. What will happen?

If a school isn’t offering in-state tuition and fees to you, and your term started after July 1, 2017, we won’t issue 
payments to the school until it becomes fully compliant and offers you the correct rate. We require this so that you or 
your family members won’t have to pay the higher out-of-state tuition rates.

## What else can affect whether I get the resident rate for tuition and fees?

Schools can legally have more requirements for you to meet to get the in-state tuition rate. You should contact your school 
to learn more about their rules and requirements. Your school will review your situation and decide if you’ll be charged the
resident rate. To learn more, find the [contact information for your school](https://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/searchInst.do) and search by state or territory.

After your school has made a decision, and you believe that it incorrectly intends to charge or has charged you more than 
the resident rate, you should [submit a complaint to the GI Bill Feedback System](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/Feedback.asp). Please include details as to why you believe either you or your 
beneficiary has been incorrectly charged out-of-state tuition. Our complaint team will review the case and take appropriate
action. If you’ve overpaid, we’ll make sure the school refunds you the overpayment.

## I’m not sure I’m really a covered individual. Could I still qualify?

Maybe. Some schools grant the resident rates to students with military connections, including current or former members of 
the Armed Forces, or dependents of current or former members of the Armed Forces. In these cases, you can get this in-state
tuition benefit whether or not you’re a covered individual.

### Can I change my education benefits?

In some cases, yes. Call <a href="tel:+18884424551">888-442-4551</a>, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (ET).

doesn’t cover.
