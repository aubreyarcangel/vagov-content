## Eligibility for in-state tuition rates

To receive payment through the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty, all public colleges, universities, and other institutions of higher learning must follow our resident rate requirement rule. This means they must, by law, charge in-state tuition and fees to all Veterans and dependents who are covered by the requirement (called covered individuals). This law applies for terms that began after July 1, 2017.

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Does my school have to charge me in-state tuition and fees?

You’re considered a covered individual, and your school must charge you in-state tuition and fees, if the below descriptions are true for you.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Are an official resident of the state where you go to school, **or**
- Live in the state where you go to school (even if it's not your official state of residence)

**And at least one of these must be true. You:**

- Served on active duty for at least 90 days and enrolled in the school within 3 years of discharge, **or**
- Are using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred to you by a Veteran who served on active duty for at least 90 days, and you enrolled in the school within 3 years of the Veteran's discharge, **or**
-	Are using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits transferred to you by an active-duty service member, **or**
-	Are using Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship benefits

**Note:** The school must continue to charge you in-state rates as long as you remain continuously enrolled. This means you stay enrolled in the same school without a break, except for regularly scheduled breaks between courses, semesters, or terms.

</div>

### I’m still serving on active duty. Does this rule apply to me?

No. You're not considered a covered individual under this law while you're still on active duty. Once you separate from service, you'll be considered a covered individual if you meet the eligibility requirements listed above.

### Can my school add more requirements to qualify for the in-state rates?

Yes. Schools can legally include more requirements to qualify for the in-state tuition rate. Contact your school to learn more about their rules and requirements. <br>

## What to do if you're not eligible or have other issues

### What should I do if my school decides I don't meet their additional requirements for in-state rates?

If you believe the school has, or intends to, incorrectly charge you more than the in-state rate, you can [submit a complaint through our GI Bill Feedback tool](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/Feedback.asp). 

Please tell us why you believe the charges are incorrect. Our team will review your case and take any needed action. 

### I’m a covered individual, but my school isn’t offering me in-state tuition and fees. What will happen?

If your school isn’t offering in-state tuition and fees to you, or to other eligible covered individuals, we'll stop paying them until they begin to fully follow the rate requirement rule.

During this time, you won't be able to use your benefits to pay for courses at the school. If you have questions or concerns about this, please call us at <a href="tel:+18884424551">888-442-4551</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. 

### I don't meet the definition of a covered individual, and I'm not an official resident of the state where I go to school. Can I still qualify for in-state rates?

It's possible. Some schools charge in-state rates to Veterans, service members, and their dependents even if they don't meet the definition of a covered individual. Contact your school to learn more about their rules and requirements. <br>
