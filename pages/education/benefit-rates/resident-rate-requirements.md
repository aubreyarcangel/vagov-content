When you use your Post-9/11 GI Bill or Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty benefits for school, your school must charge you only
in-state tuition and fee rates. This law applies to all institutions of higher learning (IHL), like colleges and universities,
for terms that began after July 1, 2017. Your IHL, must do this for all “covered individuals.”
