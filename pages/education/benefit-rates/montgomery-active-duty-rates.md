The Montgomery GI Bill for Active Duty military members (MGIB-AD/Chapter 30) is probably the most common GI Bill plan. 
This is the GI Bill plan you can buy into for $1,200 during basic training. You typically have 10 years to use your 
MGIB-AD benefits after you separate from military service.

You can use your MGIB-AD benefits while you’re on active duty or after you separate. Unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill, 
which pays the school or institution, the MGIB-AD pays you directly. Also unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the MGIB-AD 
program does not give you a housing allowance. 

If you’re a trainee on active duty, you’ll be paid back for your tuition and fees. If you’re a trainee using military tuition 
assistance (TA), your payments will make up the difference between the tuition assistance and your remaining tuition and fees.

[Learn more about the Post-9/11 GI Bill](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)
On this page, you’ll learn the monthly payment rates for the MGIB-AD, **effective August 
2018**.

## Will I get the full benefit amount?

How much you get depends on several factors. These include:
-	How long you served on active duty, **and**
-	How much of a course load you’re taking, up to full-time, **and**
-	Whether you have dependents, and how many
-	Whether you participated in the $600 Buy-Up program (see below)
