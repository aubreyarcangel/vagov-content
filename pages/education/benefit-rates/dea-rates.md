<div class="va-introtext">
  
If you’re a survivor or a dependent of a Veteran, you may qualify for education benefits. These benefits cover institutional
training, like colleges and universities and correspondence schools. They also cover special restorative training, which helps
a survivor or dependent with physical or mental disabilities so that they’ll be better able to pursue an educational program.

The rates on this page are effective **October 1, 2018**.

[Learn more about qualifying for this benefit](https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/Dep_Edu_Assist_Chapter_35.asp)

Note: On **August 1, 2018**, we’ll announce rates for three new educational programs. These include:
- Apprenticeships
-	On-the-job training
-	Farm cooperative training

Please check back then to learn what these new benefits will be.

## Schools and other institutional training

We base these benefits on the amount of time you’re attending school.

All rates in $ U.S. dollars.
| Training time | Monthly rate |
| --- | ---: |
| Full-time | 1,224.00 |
| ¾ time | 967.00 |
| ½ time | 710.00 |
| Less than ½ time and more than ¼ time | 710.00\* |
| ¼ time or less | 306.00\* |

\* Note: If you’re attending school less than half-time, you’ll be able to use this benefit only to pay for tuition and fees,
not for anything else like housing, supplies, etc. Payment can’t exceed the listed amount.

### Correspondence schools

If you attend a correspondence school, we’ll charge you an entitlement at the rate of one month for each $1,224.00 paid.

### Special restorative training

We base these benefits on the amount of time you’re getting the training, and several other factors.

-	If you’re attending special restorative training full-time, you’ll receive **a monthly payment of $1,224.00**.
-	If you’re eligible for accelerated charges, you’ll receive **a monthly payment for any tuition costs and fees over $322.00 per month**.
-	Your entitlement may be reduced one day for each **monthly payment of $40.80**, which is 1/30th of the full-time rate.
