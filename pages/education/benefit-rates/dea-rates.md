If you’re a survivor or a dependent of a Veteran, you may qualify for education benefits. These benefits cover institutional training, like colleges and universities and correspondence schools. They also cover special restorative training, which helps a survivor or dependent with physical or mental disabilities so that they’ll be better able to pursue an educational program.

The rates on this page are effective **October 1, 2018**.

[Learn more about qualifying for this benefit](https://www.benefits.va.gov/VOCREHAB/Dep_Edu_Assist_Chapter_35.asp)

Note: On **August 1, 2018**, we’ll announce rates for three new educational programs. These include:
•	Apprenticeships
•	On-the-job training
•	Farm cooperative training

Please check back then to learn what these new benefits will be.
