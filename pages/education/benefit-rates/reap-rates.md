## Rates for institutions of higher learning
**Effective October 1, 2018, to November 25, 2019**

This includes rates for colleges, universities, trade schools, and other institutions of higher learning.

- How many courses you're taking, up to full-time enrollment

**Note:** If you’re attending school less than ½-time, you can only use this benefit to pay for tuition and fees. You can't use the money for anything else, like housing, books, or supplies. Payment can’t exceed the listed amount.
