## How we determine your monthly housing allowance

### If you're enrolled full time in an approved school located in the United States

**We use the Department of Defense's (DoD) basic allowance for housing (BAH) rates for:**
- An enlisted personnel with a pay grade of E-5 who has dependents, **and**
- The zip code of the school campus where you physically attend most of your classes

**Then, we adjust your payment based on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001.**

[Use our GI Bill comparison tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool/) to find out how much money you may be eligible to receive to help pay for housing, depending on your school, benefit program, and service history. You can also find out how much we'll pay for tuition and books.

### If you're enrolled half-time or more in an approved school located in the United States

**We start with the Department of Defense's (DoD) basic allowance for housing (BAH) rates for:**
- An enlisted personnel with a pay grade of E-5 who has dependents, **and**
- The zip code of the school campus where you physically attend most of your classes

**Then, we adjust your rate based on your training time (also called your "rate of pursuit"):**

- **For undergraduate programs:** Your school will send us your term dates and credit hours. We'll use this to calculate your rate of pursuit time as a percentage of full-time enrollment (12 semester or quarter hours for most undergraduate programs). For example, if you took two 3-credit classes and a 1-credit lab, your rate of pursuit would be 58% (7 credits taken ÷ 12 credit requirement for full-time enrollment). <br> Some schools offer classes in terms that are shorter than a semester or quarter. This is especially true for online classes, summer enrollments. Other schools offer accelerated terms year-round. In these cases, we calculate weighted "equivalent credit hours" so that you'll need fewer credits to qualify for full-time (and more than half-time) enrollment.

- **For graduate programs:** Because graduate-level programs vary in the amount of credits needed for full-time training, the school provides the training time information to us. They also tell us your term dates and credit hours.

**Then, we round the monthly housing allowance to the nearest 10% level**

Once we calculate your rate of pursuit, we round the allowance to the nearest 10% level.

**For example** If your rate of pursuit is 58%, we'll pay you **60% of the applicable housing allowance**. If your rate of pursuit is 84%, we'll pay you **80% of the applicable housing allowance**.

**Then, we adjust your payment based on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001.**

### If you're enrolled at least half-time in an online program or a school in a U.S. territory or foreign country

We'll pay you a specific rate based on the type of school. We'll adjust your payment based on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001.

All rates in $ U.S. dollars
| **Type of school** | **Monthly payment** |
| -- | -- |
| Foreign school | 1,789.00 |
| Schools in U.S. territories | Equal to the current Department of Defense overseas housing allowance (OHA) based on: <ul><li>An enlisted personnel with E-5 pay grade, **and**</li><li>Your school's location</li></ul> |
| Online training with no classroom instruction | 894.50 |

## How rates may change each year

The Department of Defense adjusts the basic allowance for housing (BAH) rate, which we use to help determine your monthly housing allowance, every year on January 1. They base these adjustments on housing costs across the country. The rates are then effective starting the following August for the academic year. Rates can either go up or down each year.

### If the BAH rate increases for your school's location

You’ll see an increase in your September monthly housing allowance payment for training you received in August. 

### If the BAH rate decreases for your school's location

Your monthly payment won't decrease unless you change schools or have more than a 6-month break in training.

If you have questions about your rate, please call us at <a href="tel:+18884424551">888-442-4551</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
