## How Post-9/11 GI Bill payment rates work

The Post-9/11 GI Bill program offers several different payments for tuition and other types of allowances. We base your actual benefit rate on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001. 

### Am I eligible to receive the full benefit rates?

You’ll receive **100% of the benefit rates** if one of the below descriptions is true for you. 

**At least one of these must be true. After September 10, 2001, you served at least:**

- 36 months on active duty, **or**
- 30 days on active duty all at once, without a break (called "continuous"), and were discharged due to a service-connected disability

### What if I don't meet the requirements for full benefits?

We'll give you a percentage of the full benefit, based on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001.

| If you served at least... | But less than... | You’ll get this percentage of the full benefit rate | 
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 30 months | 36 months | 90% | 
| 24 months | 30 months | 80% | 
| 18 months | 24 months | 70% | 
| 12 months | 18 months | 60% |
| 6 months | 12 months | 50% |
| 90 days | 6 months | 40% |

**For example:** If you served on active duty for 90 days after September 10, 2001, you'd qualify for 40% of the full benefit rate. So if your school charged $22,000 for in-state tuition and fees, you'd receive $8,800 (or 40% of $22,000).

**Note:** The way we calculate your percentage of benefits will change on August 1, 2020. Please check back then for updated information.

## Full rates for school and training programs
**Effective August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020**

### Tuition and fees

| Type of school | 2019 full benefit rate |
| --- | --- |
| **Public institution of higher learning** <br>(like a public college, university, or trade school) | All tuition and fees based on the in-state student rate |
| **Private institution of higher learning** <br>(like a private college, university, or trade school)| Actual net costs up to **$24,476.79** |
| **Foreign institution of higher learning** <br>(a college, university, or trade school in a country outside the U.S.) | Actual net costs up to **$24,476.79** |
| **Non-college degree granting institution** <br> (specific training programs like HVAC repair, truck driving, EMT, or beautician school) | Actual net cost of tuition and fees based on the in-state student rate, up to **$24,476.79** |
| **Vocational flight school** <br> (a non-degree certificate or rating program)| Actual net costs up to **$13,986.72** |
| **Correspondence school** <br> (for independent and distance learning) | Actual net costs up to **$11,888.70** <br> (including all classes and enrollments beginning during the academic year, even if you don't complete them that year) |

We pay all tuition and fees directly to your school or training program.

**Note for out-of-state students at U.S. institutions of higher learning:** If you live in the state where you're going to school, even if it's not your official state of residence, [you may still qualify for the in-state fees](/education/benefit-rates/resident-rate-requirements).

### Monthly housing allowance

You may be eligible for money to help pay for your housing while you’re studying. This is called your monthly housing allowance. It's similar to the basic allowance for housing (BAH) you may have received while serving on active duty. 

We pay this allowance to you at the end of each month. <br>
[Learn about monthly housing allowance rates](/education/benefit-rates/monthly-housing-allowance-rates/)

### Education books and supplies allowance

You may be eligible for up to **$1,000** each academic year for books and supplies. We base your payment on how many courses you're enrolled in for the year.

We pay this money to you at the beginning of each term.

### Money to help you move from a highly rural area

If you need to relocate from a highly rural area so you can attend school, we may give you a one-time payment of **$500** to help with your moving expenses. This is called the Post 9/11 GI Bill rural grant. You may be eligible for this grant if the below descriptions are true for you.

**This must be true:**
You live in a county with 6 people or fewer per square mile, as determined by the most recent census. 

**And one of these must also be true. You need to:**
- Physically relocate at least 500 miles away from your home to attend school, **or**
- Travel by air to physically attend school because you don't have the option to travel by car, train, bus, or other ground transportation

### Added payments 

**If your college or university tuition costs more than the maximum payment,** you may be eligible for added payments through:
- [The Yellow Ribbon program](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/), **or**
- [Tuition assistance top-up](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/tuition-assistance-top-up/)

**If you're enrolled in a high-technology program,** you may be able to get a [single higher payment](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/accelerated-payments/) to help cover the cost of your program.

**If you’re struggling with your coursework,** you may be eligible for up to $100 per month, up to $1,200 total, for [tutorial assistance](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/tutor-assistance/).

<span id="apprenticeship"></span>
## Full rates for apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs
**Effective August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020**

### Monthly housing allowance

Because you’ll be earning a salary during your apprenticeship or on-the-job training, we won’t pay for tuition or fees. Instead, we’ll give you money to help with housing while you're training. This is called your monthly housing allowance.

For the first 6 months of training, we'll pay you the full [monthly housing allowance rate](/education/benefit-rates/monthly-housing-allowance-rates/) that you're eligible to receive. We'll pay you a lower percentage of the full rate for every 6 months you continue training beyond this.

| If you're at this point in your training... |  We'll pay this percentage of your monthly housing allowance |
| --- | ---: |
| First 6 months | 100% |
| 7 to 12 months | 80% |
| 13 to 18 months | 60% |
| 19 to 24 months | 40% |
| After 24 months | 20% |

### Money for books and supplies

We’ll pay you up to **$1,000** each academic year for books and supplies. We pay this money to you at the beginning of each term.

If you have questions about your payments, or would like to ask about changing your benefits, please call us at <a href="tel:+18884424551">888-442-4551</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
