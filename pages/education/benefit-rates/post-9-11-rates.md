The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays for many types of education, including undergraduate and graduate degrees, vocational and 
technical training, and more. The benefit levels range from 40% to 100%, and we pay benefits for 15 years after your 
release from active duty.

In addition, some dependents of service members may qualify for the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship (Fry
Scholarship), a separate benefit. The rates for the Fry Scholarship are the same as the rates for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.

On this page, you’ll learn the full pay rates for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Fry Scholarship for the **2019 academic year
(August 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020)**. You’ll also learn what the payments cover, and how much of the benefit you may qualify
for. 

## Do I qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill? 

You qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill if both of these things are true. You:
- Served at least 90 days of active-duty service after September 10, 2001, **and**
- You’ve received an honorable discharge

To qualify for the full benefit, you must have served at least 3 years of active duty after September 10, 2001. 
If you qualify for both the Active Duty GI Bill and the Reserve GI Bill, you’ll have the option to choose the benefit 
that’s right for you.

## Will I get the full benefit amount?

How much you get depends on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001. You’ll receive **100% of the benefits** if one of the following is true. You:

- Served at least 36 months on active duty, **or**
- Served at least 30 continuous days on active duty and were discharged due to service-connected disability

If you served less than 36 months, you can find the percentage of the benefit you can receive in the chart below, 
based on the time you served. 

| If you served | You’ll get this much of the full benefit | 
| --- | --- |
| At least 30 months, but less than 36 months | 90% | 
| At least 24 months, but less than 30 months | 80% | 
| At least 18 months, but less than 24 months | 70% | 
| At least 12 months, but less than 18 months | 60% |
| At least 6 months, but less than 12 months | 50% |
| At least 90 days, but less than 6 months | 40% |

## What’s this year’s Post-9/11 GI Bill pay rate for colleges and universities?

If you’re attending a college or university that grants degrees (also known as an institution of 
higher learning), we’ll pay depending on the type of school you attend. The chart below shows this year’s pay benefit.

| Type of school | Maximum tuition & fee payment for 2019 academic year |
| --- | --- |
|Public school | All tuition and fee payments at the in-state student rate, up to the national maximum of **$24,476.79** |
| Private or foreign school | Up to the national maximum of **$24,476.79** |

If you’re attending a public college or university as a non-resident, or if you’re attending a private school 
that’s more expensive than the national maximum, you may be able to get extra financial help. You can:

- Check to see if you’re eligible for extra payment under the Yellow Ribbon program.

[Learn about the Yellow Ribbon program](https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill/yellow_ribbon.asp)

- Check with your school to see if you qualify for in-state tuition rates if you live in the state where the 
school is—even if your formal state of residence is elsewhere. 

[Find your school in our interactive map](https://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/searchInst.do)

If you disagree with what your school tells you, you can file a complaint with us to see if we can help change 
the school’s decision.

## What’s the pay rate for non-college degree-granting schools?

If you attend a non-college degree school, you may be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. These schools can 
include vocational and technical training like mechanic and repair programs, emergency medical technician (EMT) 
training, barber and beautician school, and more. 

This year’s benefit for in-state tuition and fees pays up to **$24,476.79** for the academic year. 

In addition, you may be eligible for other benefits. You may be able to get:
- A monthly housing allowance, which is similar to the basic allowance for housing (BAH)
- Payment for books and supplies
- A one-time rural benefit for certain veterans
See the information below for more details on these programs.

## What’s the pay rate for apprenticeship or on-the-job training programs?

Because you’ll be earning a salary during your apprenticeship or on-the-job training, we won’t pay for tuition or fees. 
We’ll pay for your monthly housing allowance (MHA) based on where you are in your training program. The chart below shows 
the percentage of your MHA you’ll receive.

| Training period | Monthly rate |
| --- | --- |
| First 6 months of training | 100% of your applicable MHA |
| Second 6 months of training | 80% of your applicable MHA |
| Third 6 months of training | 60% of your applicable MHA |
| Fourth 6 months of training | 40% of your applicable MHA |
| Remaining pursuit of training | 20% of your applicable MHA |

[Learn more about the monthly housing allowance](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/MHA-benefits/)
We’ll also pay you up to $1,000 each academic year for books and supplies. 

### Other types of training covered by the Post-9/11 GI Bill

We’ll also cover payment for other kinds of training programs. We cover:
- **Vocational flight schools**. We’ll pay up to **$13,986.72** for the academic year. 
- **Correspondence schools**. We’ll pay up to **$11,888.70** for the academic year.
- **National testing programs and licensing and certification tests**. You can use part of your GI Bill payment to cover 
the cost of certain tests you need to take to become a licensed or certified professional—or to apply for college or 
a training course.

We’ll pay up to **$2,000** for qualifying tests and certifications. We cover only tests approved for the GI Bill, so 
find out what’s approved before you take any tests.

### Post 9/11 GI Bill and other housing allowances

In addition to the payments for tuition and fees at your school, we offer housing benefits payable while you’re 
studying. We offer a **monthly housing allowance**, also known as MHA. This benefit is similar to the basic allowance 
for housing (BAH).

### Education books and supplies allowance

We’ll pay up to **$1,000** for each academic year for books and supplies. This fee is paid proportionately, 
based on your enrollment.

### Post-9/11 GI Bill rural grant

If you need to relocate from a highly rural area so you can attend school, you may qualify 
for a one-time payment of **$500** to help with your expenses. You must be living in a county with 6 people or 
fewer per square mile, as determined by the most recent census. And one of the following must also be true. You:

- Need to physically relocate at least 500 miles to attend an educational institution, **or**
- Need to travel by air to physically attend an educational institution if no other land-based transportation exists
