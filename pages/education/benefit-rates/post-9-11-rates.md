## How Post-9/11 GI Bill payment rates work

The Post-9/11 GI Bill program offers several different payments for tuition and other types of allowances. We base your actual benefit amount for these payments on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001. 

### Am I eligible to receive the full benefit rates?

You’ll receive **100% of the benefit rates** you're eligible for if one of the below descriptions is true for you. 

**At least one of these must be true. You served at least:**

- 36 months on active duty, **or**
- 30 days on active duty all at once, without a break (called "continuous"), and were discharged due to service-connected disability

### What if I don't meet the requirements for full benefits?

We’ll calculate your payment amount based on a percentage of the maximum benefit.

| If you served at least... | But less than... | You’ll get this percentage of the full benefit rate | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30 months | 36 months | 90% | 
| 24 months | 30 months | 80% | 
| 18 months | 24 months | 70% | 
| 12 months | 18 months | 60% |
| 6 months | 12 months | 50% |
| 90 days | 6 months | 40% |

**For example:** If you had 90 days of active service since September 10, 2001, you would qualify for 40% of the maximum amount. If you served for 3 years, you would qualify for 100% of the benefit. So if your school charges $22,000 for in-state tuition and fees, you would receive $8,800 if you had 90 days of active service and the full $22,000 if you had 3 years of active service.

Note that this will change August 1, 2020. In this example, 90 days of active service would qualify you for 50% of the maximum amount as of August 1, 2020.

## Full rates for school and training programs
**Effective August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020**

### Tuition and fees

| Type of school | 2019 full benefit rate |
| --- | --- |
| Public college or university <br> (called an institution of higher learning) | All tuition and fees based on the in-state student rate |
| Private or foreign college or university <br> (called an institution of higher learning) | Actual net costs up to **$24,476.79** |
| Non-college degree granting institution <br> (specific training programs like HVAC repair, truck driving, or Emergency Medical Technician, or beautician school) | Actual net cost of tuition and fees based on the in-state student rate, up to **$24,476.79** |
| Vocational flight school | Actual net costs up to **$13,986.72** |
| Correspondence school <br> (for independent and distance learning) | Actual net costs up to **$11,888.70** <br> (including all classes and enrollments beginning during the academic year, even if you don't complete them that year) |

We pay all tuition and fees directly to your school or training program.

**Note for out-of-state students:** If you live in the state where you're going to school, you can also ask your school if you may qualify for in-state tuition even if you have a different official state of residence. <br> [Find your school in our interactive map](https://inquiry.vba.va.gov/weamspub/searchInst.do) 

If you disagree with what your school tells you, you can [file a complaint](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/Feedback.asp) with us to see if we can help change the school’s decision. 

### Monthly housing allowance

In addition to the payments for tuition and fees at your school, you may be eligible for money to help pay for your housing while you’re 
studying. This is called your monthly housing allowance (or MHA). It's similar to the basic allowance 
for housing (BAH) you may have received while serving on active duty. 

We pay this allowance to you at the end of each month. <br>
[Learn about monthly housing allowance rates](/education/benefit-rates/monthly-housing-allowance-rates/)

### Education books and supplies allowance

You may be eligible for up to **$1,000** each academic year for books and supplies. We base your payment on how many courses you're enrolled in for the year.

We pay this money to you at the beginning of each term.

### Monday to help you move if you live in a rural area

If you need to relocate from a highly rural area so you can attend school, we may pay a one-time payment of **$500** to help with your moving expenses. This is called the Post 9/11 GI Bill Rural Grant. You may be eligible for this grant if the below descriptions are true for you.

**This must be true:**

You live in a county with 6 people or fewer per square mile, as determined by the most recent census. 

**And one of these must also be true. You need to:**
- Physically relocate at least 500 miles away from your home to attend an educational institution, **or**
- Travel by air to physically attend an educational institution if no other land-based transportation exists

### Added payments 

**If your college or university tuition costs more than the maximum payment,** you may be eligible for added payments through:
- [The Yellow Ribbon program](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/), **or**
- [Tuition assistance top-up](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/tuition-assistance-top-up/)

**If you're enrolled in a high-technology program,** you may be able to get a [single higher payment](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/accelerated-payments/) to help cover the cost of your program.

**If you’re struggling with your coursework,** you may be eligible for up to $100 per month, up to $1,200 total, for [tutorial assistance](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/tutor-assistance/).

<span id="apprenticeship"></span>
## Full rates for apprenticeships and on-the-job training programs
**Effective August 1, 2019 to July 31, 2020**

### Monthly housing allowance

Because you’ll be earning a salary during your apprenticeship or on-the-job training, we won’t pay for tuition or fees. Instead, we’ll give you money to help with housing while you're training. This is called your monthly housing allowance.

For the first 6 months of training, we'll pay you the full [monthly housing allowance rate](/education/benefit-rates/monthly-housing-allowance-rates/) that you're eligible to receive. We'll pay you a lower percentage of the full rate for every 6 months you continue training beyond this.

| If you're at this point in your training... |  We'll pay this percentage of your monthly housing allowance |
| --- | ---: |
| First 6 months | 100% |
| 7 to 12 months | 80% |
| 13 to 18 months | 60% |
| 19 to 24 months | 40% |
| Remaining time after 24 months | 20% |

### Money for books and supplies

We’ll pay you up to **$1,000** each academic year for books and supplies. We pay this money to you at the beginning of each term.

If you have questions about your payments, or would like to ask about changing your benefits, please call us at <a href="tel:+18884424551">888-442-4551</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
