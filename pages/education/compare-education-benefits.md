<h2>What you should know when comparing VA education benefits</h2>

- You can only choose one education benefit to use, even if you're eligible for 2.
- Once you choose which benefit you’ll use, you can't change your mind
- If you’re eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and 2 or more other VA education benefits, you must give up one of the other education benefits. You may still be eligible for the benefit or benefits you didn't give up.
