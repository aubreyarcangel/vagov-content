<h2>What you should know when comparing VA education benefits</h2>

- You can only choose one education benefit to use, even if you're eligible for 2.
- Once you choose a benefit program, we consider your decision final. You can't change your mind.
- If you’re eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and 2 or more other VA education benefits, you must give up one of the other education benefits. You may still be eligible for the benefit or benefits you didn't give up.

If you have questions about your options, please call us at <a href="tel:+18884424551">888-442-4551</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. Or go to our [GI Bill customer service website](https://gibill.custhelp.va.gov/) to read frequently asked questions or sign in to ask your own question online.
