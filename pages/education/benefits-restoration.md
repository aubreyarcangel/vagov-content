<div class="va-introtext">

If you were receiving GI Bill education benefits, but your school either closed or lost its approval to receive payments from us (also called disapproved), you may be able to get your benefits again. Find out how we may be able to restore your benefits based on the The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (also called the Forever GI Bill).
