<h2>More information about GI Bill benefits and your school</h2>

<h3>Why did VA disapprove my school?</h3>

Most likely, we disapproved your school because they weren't meeting our resident rate requirement.

To receive payment through the Post-9/11 GI Bill and Montgomery GI Bill-Active Duty, all public colleges, universities, and other institutions of higher learning must meet this requirement. This means they must, by law, charge in-state tuition and fees to all Veterans and dependents who are covered by the requirement (called covered individuals). This law applies for terms that began after July 1, 2017.<br>
