The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays for many types of education, including undergraduate and graduate degrees, vocational and 
technical training, and more. The benefit levels range from 40% to 100%, and we pay benefits for 15 years after your 
release from active duty.

In addition, some dependents of service members may qualify for the Marine Gunnery Sergeant John David Fry Scholarship (Fry
Scholarship), a separate benefit. The rates for the Fry Scholarship are the same as the rates for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits.

On this page, you’ll learn the full pay rates for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Fry Scholarship for the **2019 academic year
(August 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020)**. You’ll also learn what the payments cover, and how much of the benefit you may qualify
for. 

## Do I qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill? 

You qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill if both of these things are true. You:
- Served at least 90 days of active-duty service after September 10, 2001, **and**
- You’ve received an honorable discharge

To qualify for the full benefit, you must have served at least 3 years of active duty after September 10, 2001. 
If you qualify for both the Active Duty GI Bill and the Reserve GI Bill, you’ll have the option to choose the benefit 
that’s right for you.

## Will I get the full benefit amount?

How much you get depends on how long you served on active duty after September 10, 2001. You’ll receive **100% of the benefits** if one of the following is true. You:

- Served at least 36 months on active duty, **or**
- Served at least 30 continuous days on active duty and were discharged due to service-connected disability

If you served less than 36 months, you can find the percentage of the benefit you can receive in the chart below, 
based on the time you served. 

| If you served | You’ll get this much of the full benefit | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| At least 30 months, but less than 36 months | 90% | 
| At least 24 months, but less than 30 months | 80% | 
| At least 18 months, but less than 24 months | 70% | 
| At least 12 months, but less than 18 months | 60% |
| At least 6 months, but less than 12 months | 50% |
| At least 90 days, but less than 6 months | 40% |

## What’s this year’s Post-9/11 GI Bill pay rate for colleges and universities?

If you’re attending a college or university that grants degrees (also known as an institution of 
higher learning), we’ll pay depending on the type of school you attend. The chart below shows this year’s pay benefit.
