The Montgomery GI Bill for Active Duty military members (MGIB-AD/Chapter 30) is probably the most common GI Bill plan. 
This is the GI Bill plan you can buy into for $1,200 during basic training. You typically have 10 years to use your 
MGIB benefits after you separate from military service.

You can use your MGIB-AD benefits while you’re on active duty or after you separate. Unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill, 
which pays the school or institution, the MGIB pays you directly. Also unlike the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the MGIB-AD 
program does not give you a housing allowance. 

If you’re a trainee on active duty, you’ll be paid back for your tuition and fees. If you’re a trainee using military tuition 
assistance (TA), your payments will make up the difference between the tuition assistance and your remaining tuition and fees.

On this page, you’ll learn the monthly payment rates for the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (Chapter 30), **effective August 
2018**.

## Will I get the full benefit amount?

How much you get depends on several factors. These include:
-	How long you served on active duty, **and**
-	How much of a course load you’re taking, up to full-time, **and**
-	Whether you have dependents, and how many
-	Whether you participated in the $600 Buy-Up program (see below)

## Pay rates for remaining entitlement for certain Vietnam Era Veterans

The rates in the charts below show your pay by your school course load and number of dependents. 
For example, if you’re attending school ¾ time and have 3 dependents, you’d start with the rate for 2 dependents, 
$1,687.00, and add $12.00 for your third dependent, for a total monthly payment of $1,699.00.

The rates are effective **October 1, 2017**.
