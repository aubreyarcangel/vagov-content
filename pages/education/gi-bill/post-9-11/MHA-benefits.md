In addition to the payments for benefits and fees at your institution of higher learning or other schools, 
you may be eligible for a monthly housing allowance, or MHA. We may pay you a housing allowance if you’re using 
any of these GI Bill educational programs:

- Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)
- Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30)
-	Select Reserve GI Bill (Chapter 1607)
-	Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)
-	Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)

## What’s my monthly housing allowance (MHA)?

If you’re using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your monthly housing allowance (MHA) is based on the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents. To qualify, you need to be enrolled at more than half-time at your school.

We calculate your MHA based on the zip code of the campus where you physically attend most of your classes, not that of the main college or university you’re enrolled in.

The rates on the rest of this page apply if you’re using the Post-9/11 GI Bill. If you’re enrolled in another GI Bill education benefits program, you may still be eligible for an MHA. Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to enter your school to see what your benefits will be.

### How we decide your monthly housing allowance

If you’re attending school at less than full-time (but still more than half-time to qualify), 
we use a formula to prorate your housing allowance. 

#### Undergraduate programs

Most undergraduate programs require 12 semester or quarter hours for full-time training. Your school will submit your term 
dates and credit hours to us, and we’ll calculate your training time, or “rate of pursuit,” which is the basis for deciding 
your housing allowance.

For example, if 12 credits is considered full-time, a course load of 7 credits yields a rate of pursuit of 58% 
(7 ÷ 12 = .58). A Veteran would need 7 credits—for example, two 3-credit classes plus a 1-credit lab—to receive this 
designation.

Some schools offer classes in terms that are shorter than a semester or quarter. This is especially true for online classes
and summer enrollments. Other schools offer accelerated terms at brick-and-mortar campuses year-round. In these cases, we
calculate weighted "equivalent credit hours" so that fewer credits are required for full-time (and more than half-time)
training.

#### Graduate programs

Because graduate-level programs vary in the amount of credits needed for full-time training, the school provides the
training time information to us. They also tell us your term dates and credit hours.

#### MHA payments
Once your training time is determined, we’ll pay you the MHA at the nearest 10% level. If your training time is determined to 
be 58%, as calculated above, you’ll be paid **60% of the applicable housing allowance**. If your training time is calculated 
to be 84%, you’ll be paid **80% of the applicable housing allowance**.

### What’s the 2019 MHA?

We base your MHA payments on the military's basic allowance for housing (BAH) rates for an E-5 with dependents. You can use a
BAH calculator to see what this year’s housing allowance is. Enter these pieces of information:

-	The zip code where you’ll be attending school, **and**
-	The pay grade (in this case, E-5), **and**
-	The year you’re receiving the benefits (in this case, 2019 BAH rates)

You’ll see two results, one for “with dependents,” and one for “without dependents.” The Post-9/11 GI Bill MHA is equal to 
the total “with dependents.”

## Do you ever change the MHA?

We base your MHA payments on the military's basic allowance for housing (BAH) rates for an E-5 with dependents. The 
Department of Defense adjusts the military BAH rate every year on January 1, based on changes to housing costs across 
the country. The rates will then be effective starting the following August for the academic year. Rates can either go up 
or down.

If the BAH rates **increased** for your area, you’ll see an increase in your September payment for training you received in
August. If the BAH **decreases** for your area, your MHA amount will not decrease unless you change schools or have more 
than a 6-month break in training.

### Are there any variations on the MHA?

Yes. The chart below shows the MHA rate for different types of schools or circumstances. There are also circumstances 
in which you’re not eligible for a housing allowance.

## MHA rate exceptions

| **Type of school** | **MHA rate** |
| -- | -- |
| Foreign school | $1,789.00 |
| Schools in U.S. territories | E-5 with dependents overseas housing allowance (OHA) for school location |
| Online training with no classroom instruction | $894.50 |
| Attending classes at ½ time or less | Not available |
| Active-duty trainee, or transferee spouse of service member | Not available |
