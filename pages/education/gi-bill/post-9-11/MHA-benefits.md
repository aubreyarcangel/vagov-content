In addition to the payments for benefits and fees at your institution of higher learning or other schools, 
you may be eligible for a monthly housing allowance, or MHA. We may pay you a housing allowance if you’re using 
any of these GI Bill educational programs:

- Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33)
- Montgomery GI Bill (Chapter 30)
-	Select Reserve GI Bill (Chapter 1607)
-	Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment (VR&E)
-	Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)

## What’s my monthly housing allowance (MHA)?

If you’re using the Post-9/11 GI Bill, your monthly housing allowance (MHA) is based on the military Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for an E-5 with dependents. To qualify, you need to be enrolled at more than half-time at your school.<br/>
We calculate your MHA based on the zip code of the campus where you physically attend most of your classes, not that of the main college or university you’re enrolled in.<br/>
The rates on the rest of this page apply if you’re using the Post-9/11 GI Bill. If you’re enrolled in another GI Bill education benefits program, you may still be eligible for an MHA. Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to enter your school to see what your benefits will be.
