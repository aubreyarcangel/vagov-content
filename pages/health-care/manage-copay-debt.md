<h3 itemprop="name">What happens if I don't pay my VA copays?</h3>

<div itemprop="text">

We're required by law to collect all copay debts for VA health care services.

You have 30 days from the time you receive a copay billing statement from us to pay the full amount, set up a payment plan to pay the amount over time, request a waiver, or dispute the charges. <br>
[Explore your options below](#copay-options).

<h4>If you don't take one of these actions within 30 days of receiving your billing statement</h4>

We're required to add late charges to your bill. This includes interest (starting from the date the charges first appeared on your statement) plus a monthly administration or collection fee, at rates we set each rate. These charges will continue to grow overtime until you pay your full balance or set up an approved repayment plan. 

<b>Note:</b> If you set up a repayment plan and don't pay your installments on time, we'll continue adding the monthly administrative or collection fee until you pay off your balance. We may add other costs if we need to take further collection action.

<h4>If you don't take one of these actions within 60 days of receiving your billing statement</h4>

We may take action to collect your copay debt. This may include offsetting other VA benefits you may receive, meaning that we would reduce or withhold part of your VA benefits (like disability compensation, GI Bill payments, or Veterans pension payments) to pay your copay debt. We may also notify credit reporting agencies, which may negatively affect your credit scores. 

<h4>If you don't take one of these actions within 120 days from the time you received your billing statement</h4>

We're required by law to transfer your debt to the U.S. Treasury. They will add more fees and interest to your copay debt. They may also:
- Offset any federal and state payments you're entitled to. This means they may reduce or withhold part of your tax refunds, Social Security benefits, or any federal or state salary or retirement benefits to pay your debt.
- Refer your account to a private collection agency, which will add more fees and interest to your debt.
- Garnish your wages from a non-federal job. This means they may take part of your wages to pay your debt.

<h2>Your options for managing VA copay debt</h3>
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if I can't pay my current VA copay debt?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If you can't pay your copay debt in full, don't panic. We have programs to help if you're struggling because of life situations like losing your job, having a sudden decrease in income, or having increases in out-of-pocket family health care expenses.

<h4>You have 2 options:</h4>

<h5>Set up a replayment plan</h5>

If you can't pay your VA debt all at once, you can set up a monthly replayment plan at any time. 
To set up a plan, fill out an Agreement to Pay Indebtedness (VA Form 1100). In paragraph 1A, tell us how much you can pay each month<br>
[Download VA Form 1100](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA1100.pdf).

Submit your completed form and a check for your first month's payment by mail or in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. Make your check payable to "VA," and include your account number and payment stub.<br>
[Find the address of your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

We'll review your proposed payment plan based on the amount of debt you owe, your ability to pay, and your ability to pay within a reasonable time. We usually require plans to pay off the full debt within 3 years.

<h5>Request a waiver of your debt</h5>

If you feel you aren't responsible for some or all of your copay debt or paying the debt would cause you undue hardship, you can request a waiver of debt. Undo hardship means paying the debt will make it very hard for you to meet your basic needs, like food and housing.

To request a waiver, fill out a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655). <br>
[Download VA Form 5655](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA5655.pdf).

Submit your completed form and a letter explaining why you're not responsible for the debt and any hardship paying your debt will cause for you. You can send your form and letter by mail or bring it in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. <br>
[Find the address of your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

You also have the right to request a hearing to explain your request in person. Submit your request for a hearing in writing along with your form. We'll send you notice about the date, time, and place where we'll hold the hearing.

<h5>Get more information or support</h5>

If you need more information or help with filling out your forms, contact your nearest VA medical center and ask to speak with the patient advocate or enrollment coordinator.<br>
[Find your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

Or call us at MyVA311 (1-844-698-2311). If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.

<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if my income has decreased and I know I won't be able to pay future VA copays?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">

If you've had a sudden decrease in income, you may be eligible for a hardship determination, which may qualify you for a copayment exemption. This means you won't have to pay any VA copays for the rest of the calendar year. You may also qualify to move into a higher priority group.

To request a hardship determination, fill out a Request for Hardship Determination (VA Form 10-10HS). <br>
