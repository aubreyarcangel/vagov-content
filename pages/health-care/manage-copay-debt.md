<h3 itemprop="name">What happens if I don't pay my VA copays?</h3>

<div itemprop="text">

We're required by law to collect all copay debts for VA health care services.

You have 60 days from the time you receive a copay billing statement from us to pay the full amount, set up a payment plan to pay the amount over time, request a waiver, or dispute the charges. <br>
[Explore your options below](#copay-options).

<h4>If you don't take one of these actions within 60 days of receiving your billing statement</h4>

We may take action to collect your copay debt. This may include offsetting other VA benefits you may receive, meaning that we would reduce or withhold part of your benefits to pay your copay debt. We may also notify credit reporting agencies, which may affect your credit scores. 

<h4>If you don't take one of these actions within 120 days from the time you received your billing statement</h4>

We're required by law to transfer your debt to the U.S. Treasury. They will add fees and interest to your copay debt. They may also:
- Offset any federal and state payments you're entitled to. This means they may reduce or withhold part of your tax refunds, Social Security benefits, or any federal or state salary or retirement benefits to pay your debt.
- Refer your account to a private collection agency, which will add fees and interest to your debt.
- Garnish your wages from a non-federal job. This means they may take part of your wages to pay your debt.

<h2>Your options for managing VA copay debt</h3>
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if I can't pay my current VA copay debt?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If you can't pay your copay debt in full, don't panic. We have programs to help if you're struggling because of life situations like losing your job, having a sudden decrease in income, or having increases in out-of-pocket family health care expenses.

<h4>You have 2 options:</h4>

<h5>Set up a replayment plan</h5>

If you can't pay your VA debt all at once, you can set up a monthly replayment plan at any time. 
To set up a plan, fill out an Agreement to Pay Indebtedness (VA Form 1100). In paragraph 1A, tell us how much you can pay each month<br>
[Download VA Form 1100](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA1100.pdf).

Submit your completed form and a check for your first month's payment by mail or in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. Make your check payable to "VA" and include your account number and payment stub.<br>
[Find the address of your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

We'll review your proposed payment plan based on the amount of debt you owe, your ability to pay, and your ability to pay within a reasonable time. Typically, a repayment plan can't spread payments out to more than 3 years.

<h5>Request a waiver of your debt</h5>

If you feel you aren't responsible for some or all of your copay debt or paying the debt would cause you undue hardship (meaning significant problems meeting your basic needs like food and housing).

To request a waiver, fill out a Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655). <br>
[Download VA Form 5655](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA5655.pdf).

Submit your completed form and a letter explaining why you're not responsible for the debt and any hardship paying your debt will cause for you by mail or in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. <br>
[Find the address of your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

You also have the right to request a hearing to explain your request in person. Submit your request for a hearing in writing along with your form. We'll send you notice about the date, time, and place where we'll hold the hearing.

<h5>Get more information or support</h5>

If you need more information or help with filling out your forms, contact your nearest VA medical center and ask to speak with the patient advocate or enrollment coordinator.<br>
[Find your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

Or call us at MyVA311 (1-844-698-2311). If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.

<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if my income has decreased and I know I won't be able to pay future VA copays?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">

If you've had a sudden decrease in income, you may be eligible for a hardship determination, which may qualify you for a copayment exemption. This means you won't have to pay any VA copays for the rest of the calendar year. You may also qualify to move into a higher priority group.

To request a hardship determination, fill out a Request for Hardship Determination (VA Form 10-10HS). <br>
[Download VA Form 10-10HS](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-10HS-fill.pdf).

<h2>How to dispute your VA copay debt</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if don't think my copay debt is valid?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You have the right to dispute all or part of your VA copay debt. To avoid late charges, you'll need to dispute the debt by the balance due date on your first billing statement.

To dispute your debt, submit a letter explaining why you question the validity or amount of your debt. Mail the letter, or bring it in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. If you send your dispute by mail, include "Billing Dispute" on the mailing envelope.<br>
[Find the address of your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

If you need help understanding your charges or submitting your dispute, call us at 866-400-1238. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET). If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.

<h4>If we receive your dispute within 60 days from the date of your first billing statement</h4>

We won't start the collection process until we've resolved your dispute.

<h4>If we receive your dispute after 60 and we've already started the collection process</h4>

We'll continue with that process while we're reviewing your dispute. If we resolve the dispute in your favor, we'll remove all late charges from your account and refund any money withheld from your VA benefits, federal payments, or wages to you.
