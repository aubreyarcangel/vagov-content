<h3>Inpatient care</h3>
<b>(Care that requires you to stay one or more days in a hospital)</b>

<h4>If you have a service-connected disability rating of 10% or higher</h4>
You won't need to pay a copay for inpatient care.

To find out, call us toll-free at 1-877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+1-877-222-8387">1-877-222-8387</a>). We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET)

<h5>2019 reduced inpatient care copay rates for priority group 7</h5>

<h3>Medications</h3>

<h4>If you’re in priority group 1</h4>
You won’t pay a copay for any medications. 

**Note:** You may be in priority group 1 if we've rated your service-connected disability as 50% or more disabling, if we've determined that you can't work because of your service-connected disability (called unemployable), or if you've received the Medal of Honor.

<h4>If you’re in priority groups 2 through 8</h4>
<b>You'll pay a copay for:</b>
- Medications your health care provider prescribes to treat non-service-connected conditions, **and**
- Over-the-counter medications (like aspirin, cough syrup, or vitamins) that you get from a VA pharmacy. You may want to consider buying your over-the-counter medications on your own.

**Note:** The cost for any medications you receive while staying in a VA or other approved hospital or health facility are covered by your inpatient care copay.

The amount you’ll pay for these medications will depend on the “tier” of the medication and the amount of medication you’re getting, which we determine by days of supply. Once you’ve paid $700 in medication copays within a year, you won’t have to pay any more even if you still get more medications. This is called a co-pay cap.

<h5>2019 outpatient medication copay amounts</h5>
| Outpatient medication tier | 1-30 day supply | 31-60 day supply | 61-90 day supply |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| <b>Tier 1</b><br> (preferred generic prescription medicines)        | $5                | $10                | $15                |
| <b>Tier 2</b><br> (non-preferred generic prescription medicines and some over-the-counter medicines)        | $8                | $16                | $24                |
| <b>Tier 3</b><br> (brand name prescription medicines)        | $11                | $22                | $33                |

<b>If you have a service-connected rating of 40% or less and your income falls at or below the national income limits for receiving free medications,</b> you may want to complete a medication copay exemption test. <br>
