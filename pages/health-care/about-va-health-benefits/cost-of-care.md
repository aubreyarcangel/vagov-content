A health insurance copay (short for “copayment”) is a fixed amount you’re required to pay each time you receive certain types of care, tests, and prescription medicines.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get free VA health care, or will I have to pay copays?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

This depends, in part, on the priority group we assign you to when you enroll in VA health care. We’ll assign you to 1 of 8 priority groups, depending on your military service history, disability rating, income level, whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, and other benefits you may be receiving (like pension benefits). 

You may also qualify for free VA health care, prescription medicines, or both if you meet certain eligibility requirements. For example, you may qualify for free care if you're a former Prisoner of War or if you have service-connected disabilities that we've rated at least 50% disabling.

If you know your priority group, keep reading below to find out what your copay may be for different types of care, tests, and prescriptions medicines. 

If you haven't yet enrolled in VA health care, you can use our Health Benefits Explorer tool to see what your copays may be. <br>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What will I pay for prescription medicines?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

<h4>If you’re in priority group 1</h4>

You won’t pay a copay for any prescription medicines.

<h4>If you’re in priority groups 2 through 8</h4>

You won’t pay a copay for medications a VA health care provider prescribes to treat a service-connected disability.

You will pay a copay for medications a VA health care provider prescribes to treat non-service-connected conditions—unless you qualify for an exemption based on your income or other factors.

The amount you’ll pay will depend on the “tier” of the medication and the amount of medication you’re getting, which we determine by days of supply. Once you’ve paid $700 in medication copays within a year, you won’t have to pay any more even if you still get more medications. This is called a co-pay cap.

<h5>2019 copay amounts by outpatient medication tier and supply</h5>

| Outpatient medication tier | 1-30 day supply | 31-60 day supply | 61-90 day supply |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| <b>Tier 0</b><br> (preventive medicines)        | $0                | $0                | $0                |
| <b>Tier 1</b><br> (preferred generic prescription medicines)        | $5                | $10                | $15                |
| <b>Tier 2</b><br> (non-preferred generic prescription medicines and some over-the-counter medicines)        | $8                | $16                | $24                |
| <b>Tier 3</b><br> (brand name prescription medicines)        | $11                | $22                | $33                |

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What will I pay for long-term or geriatric (elder) care?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

<h4>If you're in priority groups 1 or 2</h4>

You won't need to pay a copay for long-term or geriatric (elder) care.

<h4>If you're in priority groups 4, 5, 7, or 8</h4>

You won't need to pay a copay for long-term or geriatric care for the first 21 days of care. 

You'll pay a copay for services after 21 days of care—unless you qualify for an exemption based on your income or other factors. For example:
- If you're in priority group 4 and you're a former Prisoner of War, you'll only need to pay a copay if we're providing care for a non-service-connected condition.
- If you're in priority group 8 and your income is below the limit to qualify for a VA Veterans Pension, you won't need to pay a copay for these services.

<b>We'll base your copay on the level of care needed:</b>

- <b>Inpatient care:</b> You'll pay up to $97 per day to stay in a facility that provides care like a nursing home or respite care facility (a place you can stay temporarily if your family caregiver needs to be away or needs a break) or if you need to stay overnight in a VA facility for a geriatric evaluation to determine your needs and care plan.  
- <b>Outpatient care:</b> You'll pay up to $15 per day for services in a facility that don't require an overnight stay like adult day care, daytime respite care, or an outpatient geriatric evaluation.
- <b>In-home care (also called domiciliary care):</b> You'll pay up to $5 per day for care provided in your home from a visiting nurse, home health aide, or other caregiver.

Your actual copay will depend on the financial information you provide on your Application for Extended Care Services (VA Form 10-10EC).<br>
[Download VA Form 10-10EC](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-10EC-fill.pdf). <br>

<h4>If you're in priority group 6</h4>

You won’t need to pay a copay for any long-term or geriatric care related to your service-connected exposure. You may be charged a copay for care not covered under related treatment services.
