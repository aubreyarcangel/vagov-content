A health insurance copay (short for “copayment”) is a fixed amount you’re required to pay each time you receive certain types of care, tests, and prescription medicines.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get free VA health care, or will I have to pay copays?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

This depends, in part, on the priority group we assign you to when you enroll in VA health care. We’ll assign you to 1 of 8 priority groups, depending on your military service history, disability rating, income level, whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, and other benefits you may be receiving (like pension benefits). 

You may also qualify for free VA health care, prescription medicines, or both if you meet certain eligibility requirements. For example, you may qualify for free care if you're a former Prisoner of War or if you have service-connected disabilities that we've rated at least 50% disabling.

If you know your priority group, keep reading below to find out what your copay may be for different types of care, tests, and prescriptions medicines. 

If you haven't yet enrolled in VA health care, you can use our Health Benefits Explorer tool to see what your copays may be. <br>

<h2>Copay rates effective January 1, 2019</h2>

<h3>Outpatient care</h3>
<b>(Primary or specialty care that doesn't require an overnight stay)</b>

You won’t need to pay any copays for tests like X-rays, lab tests, or for preventive tests and services like screenings or immunizations.

<b>If you have a service-connected disability rating of 10% or higher,</b> you won't need to pay a copay for any type of outpatient care.

<b>If you don't have a service-connected disability rating of 10% or higher,</b> you may need to pay a copay for non-service-connected outpatient care at the rates listed below.

| Type of outpatient care | Copay amount for each visit or test | 
| ---------- | --------------- | 
| <b>Primary care services</b> <br>(like a visit to your primary care doctor)    | $15                | 
| <b>Specialty care services</b> <br>(like a visit to a hearing specialist, eye doctor, surgeon, or cardiologist)     | $50                | 
| <b>Specialty tests</b> <br>(like an MRI or CAT scan)         | $50                | 

------

<h3>Inpatient care<h3>
<b>(Care that requires you to stay one or more nights in a hospital or other health facility)</b>

<b>If you have a service-connected disability rating of 10% or higher,</b> you won't need to pay a copay for inpatient care.

<b>If you’re in priority group 7,</b> you’ll pay a reduced copay of $272.80 for the first 90 days of care within a year (365 days), and $136.40 for each additional day within the same period. You’ll also pay a $2 per day charge.

<h3>Medications</h3>

<b>If you’re in priority group 1,</b> you won’t pay a copay for any medications.

<b>If you’re in priority groups 2 through 8,</b> you'll pay a copay for medications your health care provider prescribes to treat non-service-connected conditions—unless you qualify for an exemption based on your income or other factors. You'll also pay a copay for over-the-counter medications (like aspirin, cough syrup, or vitamins) that you get from a VA pharmacy. You may want to consider buying your over-the-counter medications on your own.

If you have a service-connected rating of 40% or less and your income falls at or below the national income limits for receiving free medications, you may want to complete a medication copay exemption test. <br>
[View the current VA national income limits](http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/). <br>
[Learn about the VA financial assessment](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/cost/financial_assessment.asp).

The amount you’ll pay will depend on the “tier” of the medication and the amount of medication you’re getting, which we determine by days of supply. Once you’ve paid $700 in medication copays within a year, you won’t have to pay any more even if you still get more medications. This is called a co-pay cap.

<h5>2019 copay amounts by outpatient medication tier and supply</h5>
| Outpatient medication tier | 1-30 day supply | 31-60 day supply | 61-90 day supply |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| <b>Tier 1</b><br> (preferred generic prescription medicines)        | $5                | $10                | $15                |
| <b>Tier 2</b><br> (non-preferred generic prescription medicines and some over-the-counter medicines)        | $8                | $16                | $24                |
| <b>Tier 3</b><br> (brand name prescription medicines)        | $11                | $22                | $33                |
