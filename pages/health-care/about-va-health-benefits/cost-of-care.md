<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get free VA health care as a Veteran, or will I have to pay a copay?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may need to pay a copay for care that isn't related to a service-connected illness or injury. This will be based, in part, on the priority group we assign you to when you enroll in VA health care. We'll assign you to 1 of 8 priority groups, depending on your military service history, disability rating, income level, whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, and other benefits you may be receiving (like pension benefits). 

You may qualify for free VA health care, prescription medicines, or both if you meet certain eligibility requirements. For example, you may qualify for free care if you're a former Prisoner of War or if you have service-connected disabilities that we've rated at least 50% disabling.

<b>If you haven't applied for VA health care yet,</b> you can use our Health Benefits Explorer tool to see what your copays may be if you enroll. <br>

<h3>Medications</h3>

<h4>If you’re in priority group 1</h4>

You won’t pay a copay for any medications. 

You may be in priority group 1 if we've rated your service-connected disability as 50% or more disabling, if we've determined that you can't work because of your service-connected disability (called unemployable), or if you've received the Medal of Honor.

<h4>If you’re in priority groups 2 through 8</h4>

<b>You'll pay a copay for:</b>
- Medications your health care provider prescribes to treat non-service-connected conditions, **and**
- Over-the-counter medications (like aspirin, cough syrup, or vitamins) that you get from a VA pharmacy. You may want to consider buying your over-the-counter medications on your own.

**Note:** The cost for any medications you receive while staying in a VA or other approved hospital or health facility are covered by your inpatient care copay.

The amount you’ll pay for these medications will depend on the “tier” of the medication and the amount of medication you’re getting, which we determine by days of supply. Once you’ve paid $700 in medication copays within a year, you won’t have to pay any more even if you still get more medications. This is called a co-pay cap.

<h5>2019 outpatient medication copay amounts</h5>
| Outpatient medication tier | 1-30 day supply | 31-60 day supply | 61-90 day supply |
| --------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| <b>Tier 1</b><br> (preferred generic prescription medicines)        | $5                | $10                | $15                |
| <b>Tier 2</b><br> (non-preferred generic prescription medicines and some over-the-counter medicines)        | $8                | $16                | $24                |
| <b>Tier 3</b><br> (brand name prescription medicines)        | $11                | $22                | $33                |

<b>If you have a service-connected rating of 40% or less and your income falls at or below the national income limits for receiving free medications,</b> you may want to complete a medication copay exemption test. <br>
