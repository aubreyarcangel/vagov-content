If you’re a Veteran enrolled in VA health care, you may need to pay a fixed amount for some types of care, tests, and medications. This is called a copay (short for "copayment"). Find out how we determine your VA copay.

<h2 itemprop="name">Can I get free VA health care as a Veteran?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You can get free VA health care for any illness or injury that we determine is related to your military service (called "service connected"). <br>

You can also get certain services for free—like readjustment counseling and related mental health services, counseling and care for issues related to military sexual trauma (MST), and a registry health exam to determine if you're at risk of health problems linked to your military service.<br>

<h2 itemprop="name">Will I need to pay copays for any care or medications?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may need to pay a copay for care provided by a VA or approved community health care provider to treat conditions not related to a your service. This will depend on factors such as your disability rating, income level, military service record, and the priority group we assign you to when you enroll in VA health care. We have 8 priority groups. The higher the number of your priority group, the more likely you'll be to pay copays.<br>
