If you need private dental insurance, the VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP) 
offers two options. You can pick Delta Dental of California or MetLife for your dental coverage. 
Read more below for details about the two plans.

## What's the VADIP dental insurance program?

The Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act, 
or VADIP, provides dental insurance for qualified Veterans. [Read the VADIP fact sheet]
(https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/resources/publications/IB10-580_VADIP_factsheet.pdf).

## Am I eligible for VADIP dental insurance for Veterans?

If you’re enrolled in the VA health care system, you’re eligible. 
If your beneficiaries and dependents are enrolled in the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the 
VA (CHAMPVA), they’re also eligible.

You and your dependents can use the program if you live in the United States, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, 
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Under some circumstances, you may be eligible for free dental care. [Learn more about free VA dental services](https://www.va.gov/DENTAL/index.asp).
