## What are the benefits of the VA Dental Insurance Program?

While some Veterans enrolled in VA health care are eligible for free dental care from our providers, many are not. VADIP helps these Veterans, as well as eligible family members, to buy dental insurance at a reduced cost.

### How do I sign up for the VA Dental Insurance Program?

Once you've chosen a Delta Dental or MetLife VADIP plan, you can enroll online at:
[Delta Dental](https://feds.deltadentalins.com/vadip/), **or**
[MetLife](https://www.metlife.com/vadip/)

After you enroll, you can also use your insurance provider's website to manage your plan and benefits online.

### I signed up for the VADIP pilot program. Do I need to sign up again?

Yes. The VADIP pilot program ran from 2013 to 2017. 

If you were covered during that time, you’ll need to sign up again to be covered by the new version 
of the program. Some of the plan options and fees may have changed under the new plan.

### What if I'm also eligible for free VA dental care?

You don't have to sign up for VADIP, but you can if you'd like more dental coverage. Signing up for VA dental insurance won’t affect your ability to get free VA dental care.

### Will I be able to keep this dental insurance throughout my life?

At this time, we're allowed by law to continue this program until December 31, 2021. Please check back for more information in the future.
