## About VA Dental Insurance Program benefits and how to enroll

### Why might I want to buy private dental insurance through VADIP as a Veteran?

While some Veterans enrolled in VA health care are eligible for free dental care from our providers, many are not. Others may be eligible for free care for some, but not all, of their dental needs.

**If you're not eligible for free VA dental care,** VADIP can help you buy private dental insurance at a reduced cost.

**If you're eligible for free VA care for some of your dental needs,** you can buy a VADIP plan if you want added dental insurance. Signing up for VADIP won’t affect your ability to get free VA dental care.

### What types of dental care does VADIP cover, and how much will it cost?

**VADIP plans cover many common dental procedures. These may include:**

-	Diagnostic services
-	Preventive dental care
-	Root canals and other services to manage oral health problems and restore function (called endodontic or restorative services)
-	Dental surgery
-	Emergency dental care

The costs for your coverage will depend on the insurance company and plan you choose.

**Based on your plan, you'll pay:**
- The full insurance premium for each individual on your plan
- Any required copays when you get care

### I enrolled in the VADIP pilot program. Do I need to enroll again?

If you were covered during that time, you’ll need to enroll again to get new coverage. You should know that some of the plan options and fees may have changed.
