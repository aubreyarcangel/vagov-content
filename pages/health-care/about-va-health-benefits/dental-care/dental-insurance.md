Find out if you're eligible to buy dental insurance for Veterans and families through the VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP).

</div>

## What's the VA dental insurance program?

The VA Dental Insurance Program helps certain Veterans and dependent or surviving family members to buy dental insurance at a reduced cost. We offer plans through 2 different insurance carries: Delta Dental of California and MetLife. 

We offer this program to give Veterans and their families access to good oral health care, even if they're not eligible for VA dental care.

## I signed up for the VADIP pilot program. Do I need to sign up again?

Yes. The VADIP VA dental insurance pilot program ran from 2013 to 2017. 

If you were covered during that time, you’ll need to sign up again to be covered by the new version 
of the program. Some of the plan options and fees may have changed under the new plan.


### What if I'm also eligible for free VA dental care?

You don't have to sign up for VADIP, but you can if you'd like more dental coverage. Signing up for VA dental insurance won’t affect your ability to get free VA dental care.
