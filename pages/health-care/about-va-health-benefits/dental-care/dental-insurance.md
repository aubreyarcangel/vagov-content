If you need private dental insurance, the VA Dental Insurance Program (VADIP) 
offers two options. You can pick Delta Dental of California or MetLife for your dental coverage. 
Read more below for details about the two plans.

## What's the VADIP dental insurance program?

The Department of Veterans Affairs Dental Insurance Reauthorization Act, 
or VADIP, provides dental insurance for qualified Veterans. [Read the VADIP fact sheet](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/resources/publications/IB10-580_VADIP_factsheet.pdf).

## Am I eligible for VADIP dental insurance for Veterans?

If you’re enrolled in the VA health care system, you’re eligible. 
If your beneficiaries and dependents are enrolled in the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the 
VA (CHAMPVA), they’re also eligible.

You and your dependents can use the program if you live in the United States, 
the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, 
and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Under some circumstances, you may be eligible for free dental care. [Learn more about free VA dental services](https://www.va.gov/DENTAL/index.asp).

## What dental services does VADIP cover?

**VADIP covers many common dental procedures. These include:**

-	Diagnostic services
-	Preventive dental care
-	Endodontic (issues with the soft tissue inside the tooth) and other restorative services
-	Dental surgery
-	Emergency dental care

## What do I pay for VA dental insurance?

You pay the entire insurance premium, as well as any copays. For specific costs, 
see the details of the two plans below. 

Enrollment is voluntary. And if you already qualify for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
outpatient dental services and treatment, enrolling in VA dental insurance won’t affect those services.

## I enrolled in the VADIP pilot program. Do I need to enroll again?

Yes. The VADIP VA dental insurance pilot program ran from 2013 to 2017. 
If you were covered during that time, you’ll need to re-enroll to be covered by the new version 
of the program. Some of the plan options and fees may have changed under the new plan.
