<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h2 itemprop="name">What happens if I don't pay my bill?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

First, you should know that we won't withhold any treatment or medication from you because you can't pay your copays. But we're required by law to collect all copay debts for VA health care services.

You have 30 days from the time you receive a copay billing statement from us to pay the full amount, dispute the charges, or request financial hardship assistance (like a repayment plan or debt relief) before we'll begin to add late charges and interest. <br>
[Learn how to dispute your copay charges](/health-care/pay-copay-bill/dispute/). <br>
[Learn how to request financial hardship assistance](/health-care/pay-copay-bill/financial-hardship/).

<b>Find out what happens if you don't take one of these actions within:</b>

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-30">30 days</button>
<div id="questions-30" class="usa-accordion-content">

After 30 days, we're required to add late charges to your bill.

This includes interest (starting from the date the charges first appeared on your statement) plus a monthly administration or collection fee, at rates we set each year. These charges will continue to grow overtime until you pay your full balance or set up an approved repayment plan. 

<b>Note:</b> If you set up a repayment plan and don't pay your installments on time, we'll continue adding the monthly administrative or collection fee until you pay off your balance. We may add other costs if we need to take further collection action.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-60">60 days</button>
<div id="questions-60" class="usa-accordion-content">

After 60 days, we may take action to collect your copay debt. 

This may include offsetting other VA benefits you may receive, meaning that we would reduce or withhold part of your VA benefits (like disability compensation, GI Bill payments, or Veterans pension payments) to pay your copay debt.

We may also notify credit reporting agencies, which may cause your credit score to decrease. 

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-120">120 days</button>
<div id="questions-120" class="usa-accordion-content">

After 120 days, we're required by law to transfer your debt to the U.S. Treasury.

The U.S. Treasury will add more fees and interest to your copay debt. They may also:
- Offset any federal and state payments you're entitled to. This means they may reduce or withhold part of your tax refunds, Social Security benefits, or any federal or state salary or retirement benefits to pay your debt.
- Refer your account to a private collection agency, which will add more fees and interest to your debt.
- Garnish your wages from a non-federal job. This means they may take part of your wages to pay your debt.
