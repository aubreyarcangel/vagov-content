### Can I get benefits through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?
You’ll qualify for this program based on your Veteran’s qualifications. You may be eligible if the Veteran you're caring for meets both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true. The Veteran you're caring for:**

- Has a serious injury—including traumatic brain injury, psychological trauma, or other mental disorder—that was caused or made worse by their active-duty service on or after September 11, 2001, **and**
- Needs personal care services because they can’t perform one or more activities of daily living **and/or** needs supervision or protection based on symptoms of lasting neurological damage or injury

Answer a few questions to find out if you meet the criteria for this program. <br>

### What benefits can I get with this program? 

Your Veteran can appoint one primary (main) caregiver and up to 2 secondary caregivers (people who serve as backup support to the primary caregiver when needed). Your benefits will depend on whether you’re the primary caregiver or a secondary caregiver.

**If you’re the primary caregiver, you may receive:**
- Caregiver education and training
- A monthly stipend (payment)
- Travel, lodging, and financial assistance when traveling with the Veteran to receive care
- Access to health care benefits through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA)—if you don't already qualify for care or services under another health care plan.<br>
[Learn more about CHAMPVA](/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/)
- Mental health services and counseling
- Up to 30 days per year of respite care
