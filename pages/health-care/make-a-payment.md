<h2 itemprop="name">What if I can't pay my bill?</h2>

<div itemprop="text">

You have options such as requesting a monthly repayment plan or disputing the charges on your billing statement. But you need to act quickly. If you don't pay your balance or set up an approved repayment plan within 30 days, we're required by law to add late charges. These charges include interest (starting from the date the charges first appeared on your statement) plus a monthly administrative cost or collection fee. <br>
