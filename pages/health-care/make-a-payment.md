<h2>What you need to know about paying your VA copays</h2>

You'll need to pay your balance in full by the due date on your first billing statement. If you don't pay your bill on time, we may add late charges, offset other VA benefits, or refer your debt to the U.S. Treasury for collections that can affect your other VA and federal or state benefits or even your wages.

<b>If you're having trouble paying your copays,</b> you have options such as requesting a repayment plan or disputing the charges on your billing statement. But you need to act quickly. <br>

<b>If you need help understanding your bill or have a question about the charges,</b> call us at <a href="tel:+18664001238">1-866-400-1238</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. (ET). <br> Or visit your nearest VA medical center or other health facility and ask to talk with a member of the facility's revenue staff. <br>
