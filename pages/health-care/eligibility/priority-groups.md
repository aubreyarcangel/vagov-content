<div itemprop="text">

When you apply for VA health care, we’ll assign you to 1 of 8 priority groups. This system helps to make sure that Veterans who need care right away can get signed up quickly. It also helps to make sure we can provide high quality care to all Veterans enrolled in the VA health care program.

**Your priority group may affect:**
- How soon we sign you up for health care benefits, **and**
- How much (if anything) you’ll have to pay toward the cost of your care <br>

**We'll base your priority group on:**

- Your military service history, **and**
- Your disability rating, **and**

We assign Veterans with service-connected disabilities the highest priority. We assign the lowest priority to Veterans who earn a higher income and who don’t have any service-connected disabilities qualifying them for disability compensation (monthly payments).

If you qualify for more than one priority group, we'll assign you to highest one.
