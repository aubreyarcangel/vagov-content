We use VA priority groups to help make sure that we can get care quickly to Veterans who need it most, and that we can deliver full health care benefits and the highest quality care to all Veterans enrolled in the VA health care program.

<h2 itemprop="name">How do VA priority groups affect my eligibility and benefits?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

**Your VA priority group helps to determine:**
- How quickly you'll be enrolled in VA health care, **and**
- Whether you'll need to pay copays for certain types of non-service-connected care and medications

If you're assigned to priority group 7 or 8, you'll need to agree to pay copays to receive VA health care benefits.
