<h2>Understanding copay debt and collection</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What happens if I don't pay my VA copays?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

First, you should know that we won't withhold any treatment or medication from you because you can't pay your copays. But we're required by law to collect all copay debts for VA health care services.

You have 30 days from the time you receive a copay billing statement from us to pay the full amount, set up a payment plan to pay the amount over time, request a waiver, or dispute the charges. <br>
[Explore your options below](#copay-options).

<b>Find out what happens if you don't take one of these actions within:</b>

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-30">30 days</button>
<div id="questions-30" class="usa-accordion-content">

After 30 days, we're required to add late charges to your bill. This includes interest (starting from the date the charges first appeared on your statement) plus a monthly administration or collection fee, at rates we set each rate. These charges will continue to grow overtime until you pay your full balance or set up an approved repayment plan. 

<b>Note:</b> If you set up a repayment plan and don't pay your installments on time, we'll continue adding the monthly administrative or collection fee until you pay off your balance. We may add other costs if we need to take further collection action.

</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-60">60 days</button>
<div id="questions-60" class="usa-accordion-content">

After 60 days, we may take action to collect your copay debt. This may include offsetting other VA benefits you may receive, meaning that we would reduce or withhold part of your VA benefits (like disability compensation, GI Bill payments, or Veterans pension payments) to pay your copay debt. We may also notify credit reporting agencies, which may negatively affect your credit scores. 

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-60">120 days</button>
<div id="questions-120" class="usa-accordion-content">

After 120 days, we're required by law to transfer your debt to the U.S. Treasury. They will add more fees and interest to your copay debt. They may also:
- Offset any federal and state payments you're entitled to. This means they may reduce or withhold part of your tax refunds, Social Security benefits, or any federal or state salary or retirement benefits to pay your debt.
- Refer your account to a private collection agency, which will add more fees and interest to your debt.
- Garnish your wages from a non-federal job. This means they may take part of your wages to pay your debt.

<h2>How to request financial hardship assistance</h2>

<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if I can't pay my current VA copay debt due to financial hardship?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

First, don't panic. We have programs to help if you're struggling because of life situations like losing your job, having a sudden decrease in income, or having increases in out-of-pocket family health care expenses.

<h4>You have 2 options if you can't pay your current copay debt due to financial hardship:</h4>

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-repayment">Set up a repayment plan to pay your debt over time</button>
<div id="questions-repayment" class="usa-accordion-content">

If you can't pay your VA debt all at once, you have the right to set up a monthly repayment plan at any time. We'll review your proposed payment plan based on the amount of debt you owe and your ability to pay within a reasonable time. We usually require you to pay off the full debt within 3 years.

<b>To set up a plan:</b>

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one"><b>Fill out an Agreement to Pay Indebtedness (VA Form 1100).</b> <br>
    In paragraph 1A, tell us how much you can pay each month.<br>

  <li class="process-step list-two"><b>Then submit your completed form and a check for your first month's payment.</b> <br>
    You can send these by mail or bring them in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. Make your check payable to "VA," and include your account number and payment stub.<br>
<a href="/find-locations/">Find the address of your nearest VA medical center</a>.</li>
  <li class="process-step list-three"><b>Once we approve your repayment plan, begin sending your payments.</b><br>
    If you received a coupon book with your approved repayment plan, please send payments to the address shown on the coupon. You can also make a payment by mail or in person at your VA medical center's facility revenue office.</li>
</ol>

<b>Note:</b> Repayment plans don't include new charges you receive after submitting your proposed plan. If you submit your plan and then receive a bill with new charges, please submit a new VA Form 1100 and letter with a plan for the new charges. If you keep receiving new charges, please call us at <a href="tel:+18664001238">1-866-400-1238</a> every 90 days to request a new repayment plan.

You have the right to request a waiver (request for debt relief), write-off (termination of debt), or compromise (negotiation of a lower payment amount) of part or all of your balance. If we grant part or all of your request, you won't have to pay the amount of the balance we agree to relieve.

<b>To request debt relief:</b>

<h3 itemprop="name">What can I do if my income has decreased and I won't be able to pay future copays?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If your gross household income has decreased, you may be eligible for a hardship copay exemption. This means we'll assign you to a higher priority group, and you won't have to pay any VA copays for the rest of the calendar year.

<b>Note:</b> A hardship copay exemption doesn't apply to copays for pharmacy medications.

<b>To request a hardship determination:</b>

<h2>How to dispute copay debt you disagree with</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What should I do if I disagree with the charges on my VA patient statement?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You have the right to dispute all or part of your VA copay debt. To avoid late charges, you'll need to dispute the debt by the balance due date on your first billing statement.

To dispute your debt, submit a letter explaining why you question the validity or amount of your debt. Mail the letter, or bring it in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. If you send your dispute by mail, include "Billing Dispute" on the mailing envelope.

You can choose to have legal representation for all VA payment disputes. You can work with a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) or other VA-recognized service organization for free, or hire an attorney or a VA-accredited agent (a trusted professional who's trained an certified in our processes) for a limited fee set by law
