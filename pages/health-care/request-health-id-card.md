If you’re enrolled in the VA health care system, you’ll get a Veteran Health Identification 
Card (VHIC). You’ll use it for identification and to check in for your health care appointments. 
You may also use this card to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, 
and restaurants. If you have a VHIC, you don’t need another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran.
