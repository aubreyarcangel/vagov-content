## What's a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC), and how will I use it?

When you’re enrolled in VA health care, you'll use your Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) to check in to your appointments at VA medical centers. This secure ID card keeps your personal information safe while giving us the information we need to easily access your VA health record.

You may also use this card to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. If you have a VHIC, you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts.

**Note:** You can't use your VHIC as a credit card or insurance card. It also doesn't authorize or pay for care at non-VA health facilities.

## How do I get my VHIC?

First, you'll need to be enrolled in VA health care to receive your VHIC.
If you're not already enrolled, [find out how to apply for VA health care](/health-care/how-to-apply/).

After we verify your enrollment, you can go to your nearest VA medical center to request your VHIC and get your picture taken for your card. You'll need to show a current form of primary identification at this time.

**Please bring your current, unexpired:**

- State-issued driver’s license, **or**
- U.S. passport or passport card, **or**
- Other government ID issued by a federal, state, or local government agency <br> **Note:** This ID must show your picture and date of birth. If it doesn't also show your address, you'll need to bring another document to confirm your address. This may include your electric bill, cable bill, 
or voter registration card, or another mailed document.

## How and when will I get my VHIC?

After we take your picture, we'll process your VHIC and send it to you by mail. You should receive it within  10 days. 

**If it's been 10 days since you've had your picture taken and you haven’t received your card**, please call the [VA medical center](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?zoomLevel=4&page=1&address=&facilityType=health&serviceType) where you had your picture taken. Or call us at <a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>. We're here Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. 

## What should I do if my VHIC is lost or stolen?

Contact the [VA medical center](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/?zoomLevel=4&page=1&address=&facilityType=health&serviceType) where you had your picture taken to ask for a new card. Or call us at <a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. 

**Note:** You’ll need to bring your driver's license, passport, or other government ID again when you go to get a replacement card.

## What should I do with my old Veterans identification card?

Please destroy it by cutting it up or shredding it. We want all Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care to have the new VHIC. This new card offers even more security to protect your personal information.

It also offers other helpful new features. These include "VA" printed in braille to help Veterans with low vision to quickly recognize the card as well as a display of your latest branch of service emblem and a list of special awards you may have received.
