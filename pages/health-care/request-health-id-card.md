If you’re signed up for the VA health care system, you’ll get a Veteran Health Identification 
Card (VHIC). You’ll use it for identification and to check in for your health care appointments. 
You may also use this card to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, 
and restaurants. If you have a VHIC, you don’t need another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran.

## How do I get this VA health ID card?

Veterans must first be signed up for the VA health care system to receive a VHIC. There are three ways to sign up:

**By phone**

You can call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>), Monday through 
Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. 

**Online** 

You can apply [online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/how-to-apply/).

**In person** 

You can apply at your local VA medical center.

After we verify that you are signed up, we’ll take your picture at your local VA medical center. 
You’ll also need to provide one form of identification when you apply. After this step, 
we’ll mail you your VHIC identification card.

## What kind of ID do I need when I apply for a VHIC?

You’ll need to bring one of the following types of identification:

- A current primary identification card
- A state-issued driver’s license
- A U.S. passport or passport card
- Another government ID card. This ID can be issued by federal, state, or local government agencies, 
as long as it contains your picture, your date of birth, and your address. 

If this government ID card doesn't contain your address, you can provide another document 
to prove your address. Acceptable documents include your electric bill, your cable bill, or 
your voter registration card.

## What do I do if I haven’t received my VHIC yet?

Once you have your picture taken, you should receive your VHIC card in 10 days. 
If you haven’t received it, you can call your local VA medical facility, or call 
877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>).

## What do I do with my old Veterans Identification Card (VIC)?

We want all Veterans who are signed up for the VA health care system to have the VHIC, which 
is more secure and protects your personal information. If you have the old VIC, 
you should destroy it by cutting it up or shredding it.

## What are the advantages of using a VHIC?

A VHIC is a more secure ID card. A VHIC gives you:

- **Increased security for your personal information.** No personal information is on the magnetic strip or bar code.
- **Easy access to your unique member identifier.** The Department of Defense assigns you a unique member identifier, 
also called an electronic data interchange personal identifier or EDIPI. This identifier allows us to easily 
find your health record.
- **Accessibility features.** The letters “VA” are inscribed in Braille to help visually impaired Veterans 
recognize and use the card.
- **Protection against counterfeiting and identity theft.** Microtext helps prevent reproductions.
- **A salute to your military service.** The card shows the emblem of your latest branch of service, 
as well as some special awards if they apply.

## What do I do if my VHIC is lost or stolen?
If your VHIC is lost or stolen, contact the VA medical facility where your picture 
was taken to ask for a new card. You may also call 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>). You’ll need to
provide identification information again.

## What do I do if I still have questions?

Call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>), Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. 

## Interested in another type of VA ID card?
