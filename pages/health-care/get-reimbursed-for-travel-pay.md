<div class="va-introtext">
  
VA offers health care travel benefits, also called the Beneficiary Travel program (BT). 
The program pays for your mileage and other travel expenses for when you travel to and 
from health care appointments. If you qualify, we’ll reimburse you for payments you make for this travel.

## What kinds of travel expenses do you cover?

**We pay for visits to appointments at a VA health care facility, as well as VA-authorized non-VA health care. We cover:**

-	Mileage to and from a provider appointment. The current mileage reimbursement rate is **41.5 cents ($0.415) per mile**
-	Ticket costs for public transportation, including train, bus, taxi, light rail, and plane
-	Special types of transportation (also called “special mode”) if you need them, including ambulance, wheelchair van, and more

## How do I find out if I qualify for beneficiary travel reimbursement?
