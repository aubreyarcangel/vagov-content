VA offers health care travel benefits, also called the Beneficiary Travel program (BT). 
The program pays for your mileage and other travel expenses for when you travel to and 
from health care appointments. If you qualify, we’ll reimburse you for payments you make for this travel.  

</div>

## What kinds of travel expenses do you cover?

**We pay for visits to appointments at a VA health care facility, as well as VA-authorized non-VA health care. We cover:**

-	Mileage to and from a provider appointment. The current mileage reimbursement rate is **41.5 cents ($0.415) per mile**
-	Ticket costs for public transportation, including train, bus, taxi, light rail, and plane
-	Special types of transportation (also called “special mode”) if you need them, including ambulance, wheelchair van, and more

## How do I find out if I qualify for beneficiary travel reimbursement?

There are two types of beneficiary travel reimbursement, and you may qualify for one or both. 
**To qualify for general health care travel reimbursement, you need to meet at least one of these criteria. You:**

- Have a VA disability rating (a rating that measures how bad or severe a disability is) of 30% or more, **or**
- Are traveling for treatment of a service-related condition, even if your VA disability rating is less than 30%, **or**
- Receive a VA pension, or your income doesn’t exceed the maximum annual VA pension rate, **or**
- Are traveling for a scheduled VA claim exam (also called a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam), **or** 
- Can’t afford to pay for your travel, according to the BT guidelines

Sometimes, other people can also get this benefit. To learn if you qualify, 
you can call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>).

## How do I qualify for “special mode” transportation?

**First, you need to meet one of the conditions in the list above. Second, you must also:**

-	Have a medical condition requiring an ambulance or a specially equipped van, which is determined by a VA health care provider, **and** 
-	Have your travel preauthorized. We don’t require authorization for emergencies if a delay would be hazardous to life or health. 

Learn how to get your travel preauthorized. 

## How do I get these travel benefits?

When you travel to a health care appointment, you’ll save and submit your expenses along with the reimbursement form. 
## Here’s what you’ll do for each appointment:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">
  
##### After each medical appointment requiring travel, print and fill out the [VA Form 10-3542](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-3542-fill.pdf).  

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

##### Pay your travel expenses, and note your mileage and keep any related receipts.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

##### Submit your completed form. You can:

-	Take it in person to your VA facility’s beneficiary travel office, **or**
-	Mail or fax it to your VA facility’s beneficiary travel office
If you have questions, you can call your VA facility’s beneficiary travel office. 
You can also call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">
  
Be sure to submit your form within 30 days of your health care appointment.  

</li>

<li class="process-step list-five">
  
We’ll review your form, and when we approve it, we’ll send you a reimbursement for your expenses.  

## How do I file ambulance claims? 

We have a special system to handle your ambulance claims. It’s called the fee-based claims 
system, or FBCS. This system will help us handle these claims more quickly and get you your reimbursement faster.

For more information on this FBCS process, please email us at <a href="mailto:VHABeneficiaryTravelQuestions@va.gov">VHABeneficiaryTravelQuestions@va.gov</a>.

## What’s the mileage reimbursement?

The current mileage reimbursement is 41.5 cents ($0.415) per mile. We calculate 
your mileage using the fastest and shortest route according to [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?FORM=LGCYVD). 
Each trip is measured door to door. 

Your scheduled appointments qualify for round-trip mileage. Unscheduled visits may be 
limited to return mileage only. We’ll reimburse you for travel to the closest VA facility to you, 
unless we decide a different location is better for your needs.

## Is there a deductible for the beneficiary travel benefit?

Yes. The deductible is $3 one-way or $6 round-trip for each appointment. 
The most you’ll pay in deductibles each month is $18. After you pay $18 in a month, 
we’ll cover the entire cost of your travel for the rest of that month.

## Can VA waive this deductible?

Yes. Some Veterans can have their monthly travel deductible expense waived. 
**You don’t need to pay this fee if you qualify for travel and are covered by any of these. You’re:**

-	Getting a VA pension, or
-	Traveling for a scheduled compensation and pension exam, **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran and your income last year doesn’t exceed the applicable VA pension rate, **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran and what you expect to earn this year doesn’t exceed the applicable VA pension rate, **or**
-	A service-connected Veteran and your income last year doesn’t exceed the applicable national means test income limit, **or**
-	A service-connected Veteran and what you expect to earn this year doesn’t exceed the applicable national means test 
income limit
