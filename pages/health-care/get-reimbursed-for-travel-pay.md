## How to get reimbursed for your health-related travel

### How do I get VA travel pay for scheduled appointments?

When you travel to a health care appointment, you’ll save and submit your expenses along with the reimbursement form. 

#### For each scheduled appointment

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">
  
##### Fill out a claim for reimbursement

You'll need to fill out a new Veteran/Beneficiary Claim for Reimbursement of Travel Expenses (VA Form 10-3542) for each appointment. <br>
[Download VA Form 10-3542](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/vha-10-3542-fill.pdf)  

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

##### Gather your receipts

Be sure to keep your receipts for all private or public transportation.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

##### Submit your completed form and receipts within 30 days of your appointment

You can mail, fax, or take your form and receipts in person to the VA facility where you received care. 

If you have questions, you can call your VA facility’s beneficiary travel office. 
You can also call our toll-free hotline at 877-222-VETS (<a href="tel:+18772228387">877-222-8387</a>).

</li>
</ol>
  
We’ll review your form. We’ll then send you a check to reimburse you for approved expenses.

### For ambulance claims

We have a special system to handle your ambulance claims. It’s called the fee-based claims 
system, or FBCS. This system will help us handle these claims more quickly and get you your reimbursement faster.

For more information on this FBCS process, please email us at <a href="mailto:VHABeneficiaryTravelQuestions@va.gov">VHABeneficiaryTravelQuestions@va.gov</a>.

## More about VA travel pay

### What’s the current VA mileage reimbursement?

The current mileage reimbursement is 41.5 cents ($0.415) per mile. We calculate 
your mileage using the fastest and shortest route according to [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?FORM=LGCYVD). 
We measure each trip door to door. 

Your scheduled appointments qualify for round-trip mileage. Unscheduled visits may be 
limited to return mileage only. We’ll reimburse you for travel to the closest VA facility to you, 
unless we decide a different location is better for your needs.

### Is there a deductible for the beneficiary travel benefit?

Yes. The deductible is $3 one-way or $6 round-trip for each appointment, up to $18 total each month.

After you pay $18 in a month, we’ll cover the entire cost of your travel for the rest of that month.

### Can VA waive this deductible?

Yes. Some Veterans can have their monthly travel deductible expense waived. 
**You don’t need to pay this fee if you're eligible for travel and are covered by any of these. You’re:**

-	Receiving a VA pension, **or**
-	Traveling for a scheduled compensation and pension exam, **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran and your income last year doesn’t exceed the applicable VA pension rate, **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran and what you expect to earn this year doesn’t exceed the applicable VA pension rate, **or**
-	A service-connected Veteran and your income last year doesn’t exceed the applicable national means test income limit, **or**
-	A service-connected Veteran and what you expect to earn this year doesn’t exceed the applicable national means test 
income limit
