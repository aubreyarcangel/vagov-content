## Eligibility

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

### Am I eligible to receive VA travel pay as a Veteran?

You may be eligible for 1 or both of our 2 types of travel pay.
<br>
#### General health care travel reimbursement

This includes regular transportation, such as by car, plane, train, bus, taxi, or light rail. You may be eligible if you're traveling for care at a VA health facility or for VA-approved care at a facility in your community, and at least one of the below descriptions is true for you.

**At least one of these must be true. You:**

- Have a [VA disability rating](/disability/about-disability-ratings/) of 30% or higher, **or**
- Are traveling for treatment of a service-connected condition, even if your VA disability rating is less than 30%, **or**
- Receive a [VA pension](/pension/veterans-pension-rates/), **or**
- Have an income that's below the [maximum annual VA pension rate](/pension/veterans-pension-rates/), **or**
- Are traveling for a scheduled [VA claim exam](/disability/va-claim-exam/) (also called a compensation and pension, or C&P, exam), **or** 
- Can’t afford to pay for your travel, as defined by our guidelines

**Note:** Veterans traveling for VA-approved transplant care are automatically eligible for reimbursement. If you're a Veteran with a different special VA designation, you'll need to meet the eligibility requirements listed above.
<br>
#### Special mode transportation

This includes transportation by a vehicle specially designed to transport people with disabilities, like an ambulance, ambulette, air ambulance, or wheelchair vain. You may be eligible if you're traveling for care at a VA health facility or for VA-approved care at a facility in your community, and all of the below descriptions are true for you.

**All of these must be true:**

- You're eligible for general health care travel reimbursement, **and**
-	A VA health care provider determines that your medical condition requires an ambulance or a specially equipped van for travel, **and** 
-	We've approved your travel in advance, unless the travel is for an emergency situation where a delay would threaten your life or health

</div>

<span id="reimbursement"></span>
## Reimbursement benefits, rates, and deductibles

### What travel expenses does VA travel pay reimburse?

**We pay for travel to care at a:**
- **VA health care facility** (the closest facility to your home unless your VA health care provider determines that you need to travel to a different facility)
- **Non-VA health care facility** (if we've approved the care in advance or your travel is for a life-threatening emergency)

**This may include reimbursement for:**
-	Mileage driven to and from a provider appointment
- Bridge, road, and tunnel tolls
- Parking
- Taxi and plane fares
-	Ticket costs for public transportation, including train, subway, bus, ferry, or light rail
-	Transportation by a specially equipped vehicle, like an ambulance or wheelchair van (if your VA health care provider determines this is medically necessary for you or your travel is for a life-threatening emergency)
- Meals and lodging in some cases (if we've approved this reimbursement in advance)

### What's the current VA mileage reimbursement rate?

We currently pay **41.5 cents ($0.415)** per mile for approved, health-related travel. 

**You should know that we:**
- **Use [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?FORM=LGCYVD) to calculate your mileage,** based on the fastest and shortest route from your home to the health care facility ("door to door")
- **Pay round-trip mileage for your scheduled appointments,** but may only pay return mileage for unscheduled visits
- **Reimburse you for travel to the closest VA health facility that provides the care you need,** unless your VA health care provider determines that you need to travel to another facility for care

### When, and how much, will VA pay for my meals and lodging?

In some cases, we may reimburse you for the actual cost, up to 50% of the local government employee rate, for meals or lodging. We determine the need for meals and lodging on a case-by-case basis based on:
- Your medical condition, **and**
- How far you need to travel for care, **and**
- Other circumstances

You'll need to provide all receipts for lodging and meals.

Except in certain unusual cases, you can only get this reimbursement if we approve it before you travel. And we won't reimburse you for lodging or meals if you chose to stop or take a less direct route to a VA or VA-authorized health facility. 

### Will I have to pay a deductible before getting VA travel reimbursement?

Yes. The deductible is **$3** one-way or **$6** round-trip for each appointment, up to **$18** total each month.

After you pay $18 within one month, we’ll pay the full cost of your approved travel for the rest of that month.

**Note** We charge this deductible because we're required by law to withhold certain amounts from travel reimbursement payments. The money we withhold helps to pay for travel or medical care for other Veterans.

### Can I get this deductible waived so I don't have to pay it?

We may waive this deductible for you if it would result in a several financial hardship. You don’t need to pay the deductible if you're eligible for travel pay and any of the below descriptions are true for you.

**One of these must be true. You're:**

-	Receiving a [VA pension](/pension/veterans-pension-rates/), **or**
-	Traveling for a scheduled [VA claim exam](/disability/va-claim-exam/), **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran, and your income last year was below the [maximum annual VA pension rate](/pension/veterans-pension-rates/), **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran, and what you expect to earn this year doesn’t exceed our maximum annual VA pension rate, **or**
-	A service-connected Veteran, and your income last year falls below the [VA national income limit](https://www.va.gov/HEALTHBENEFITS/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) for health care benefits and prescriptions, **or**
-	A service-connected Veteran and what you expect to earn this year doesn’t exceed our national income limit for health care benefits and prescriptions 

If we determine that you qualify for a waiver, we'll automatically waive your deductible. You can also request a waiver in person or in writing.

**Note:** We consider Aid and Attendance and Housebound benefits for 100% service-connected Veterans to be special monthly compensation and not a VA pension.

### More about VA travel pay 

<ul class="usa-accordion">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="not-closest">What if I choose to go to a VA health facility that's not the closest one to my home?</button>
<div id="not-closest" class="usa-accordion-content">

You can go to any VA health facility you choose to for care. But, if you choose to go a facility other than the one that's closest to your home with your VA health care provider determining the extra travel is needed, you'll need to pay for any costs above the amount for travel to your closest facility. This includes paying for any added mileage, public or private transportation costs, or special mode transportation.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="po-box">What if I my official address is a PO Box?</button>
<div id="po-box" class="usa-accordion-content">

You'll need to establish an official place of residence so we can determine your travel pay to the closes VA or VA-authorized health facility that can provide the care you need. We may ask you to provide documentation confirming your home address.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="change-residence">What if I change my residence while receiving care from VA (such as during a lengthy hospital stay)?</button>
<div id="change-residence" class="usa-accordion-content">

For your return trip home, we'll reimburse you for the distance (mileage) to your new residence. But we won't pay more than the amount that we'd allow from the VA health facility where the care or services could have been provided that's closest to your new residence.

**For example:** If you lived in Baltimore, Maryland when you entered a VA hospital for care, but then changed your home address to Detroit, Michigan during your hospital stay, we would reimburse you for travel up to the amount we'd pay for the distance from your new Detroit home to the nearest VA or VA-approved facility that could have provided your care.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="emergency">What if I need transportation to a non-VA health facility in an emergency?</button>
<div id="emergency" class="usa-accordion-content">

**We can provide travel in certain emergency situations:**

- **If you have an emergency while receiving care at a VA health facility and the facility can't provide the car you need,** we can pay for your transport to a non-VA facility for emergency treatment and back to the VA facility. As long as we've approved the care at the non-VA facility, we'll pay for this transportation even if you're not eligible for travel pay.
- **If you have an emergency and you're anywhere other than at a VA health facility,** we can pay for your transport to a non-VA facility for emergency treatment. As long as we've approved the care at the non-VA facility, we'll pay for this transportation even if you're not eligible for travel pay. But, once you're in a stable medical condition, you'll need to meet travel pay and medical expense eligibility requirements to receive any further reimbursement.

Notify us as soon possible, but no later than 30 days from the date of transport.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="veteran-employee">If I have an appointment at the VA health facility where I work or volunteer, can I still get reimbursed for travel?</button>
<div id="non-veteran" class="usa-accordion-content">

**If you're a Veteran employee who's eligible for reimbursement, or if you're a compensated work therapy patient**

We'll reimburse you for travel to and from your scheduled appointments. This includes appointments scheduled on a day when you're working or volunteering at the same VA health facility. For unscheduled appointments, we may reimburse you for one-way travel if you're seen as a Veteran and not an employee.

**If you're a volunteer**

You're eligible for travel pay whether or not you volunteer on the same day as your appointment.

<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="veteran-employee">If I travel together with another Veteran, or take free transportation, can I still get reimbursement? </button>

- Shared a vehicle, like a taxi, with other veterans and paid your own fare, **or**
