## More about VA travel pay

### What’s the current VA mileage reimbursement rate?

We currently pay **41.5 cents ($0.415)** per mile for approved, health-related travel. 

**You should know that we:**
- Use [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps?FORM=LGCYVD) to calculate your mileage based on the fastest and shortest route from your home to the health care facility ("door to door")
- Pay round-trip mileage for your scheduled appointments, but may only pay return mileage for unscheduled visits
- Reimburse you for travel to the closest VA health facility, unless your VA health care provider determines that you need to travel to another facility for care

### Will I have to pay a deductible before getting VA travel reimbursement?

Yes. The deductible is **$3** one-way or **$6** round-trip for each appointment, up to **$18** total each month.

After you pay $18 within one month, we’ll pay the full cost of your approved travel for the rest of that month.

### Can I get this deductible waived so I don't have to pay it?

We may waive this deductible for you in certain cases. You don’t need to pay the deductible if you're eligible for travel pay and any of the below descriptions are true for you.

**One of these must be true. You're:**

-	Receiving a [VA pension](/pension/veterans-pension-rates/), **or**
-	Traveling for a scheduled [VA claim exam](/disability/va-claim-exam/), **or**
-	A non-service-connected Veteran, and your income last year was below the [maximum annual VA pension rate](/pension/veterans-pension-rates/), **or**
