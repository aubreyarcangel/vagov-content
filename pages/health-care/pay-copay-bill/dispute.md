<div itemprop="text">

To dispute your debt, submit a letter explaining why you question the validity or amount of your debt. Mail the letter, or bring it in person to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. If you send your dispute by mail, include "Billing Dispute" on the mailing envelope. <br>
[Find the address for your nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

<b>If we receive your dispute within 60 days from the date of your first billing statement,</b> we won't start the collection process until we've resolved your dispute.

<b>If we receive your dispute after 60 and we've already started the collection process,</b> we'll continue with that process while we're reviewing your dispute. If we resolve the dispute in your favor, we'll remove all late charges from your account and refund any money withheld from your VA benefits, federal payments, or wages to you.
