You have the right to dispute all or part of your VA copay charges. To avoid late charges, you'll need to dispute the debt within 30 days of receiving your bill.

<h2 itemprop="name">How do I dispute my VA copay charges?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

Write a letter explaining why you think the copay charges or balance amount may not be correct.

Mail the letter, or bring it in person, to the business office or health administration office at your nearest VA medical center. If you send your dispute by mail, please include "Billing Dispute" on the mailing envelope. <br>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h2 itemprop="name">Will VA still go through the debt collection process if I dispute the charges?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

This depends on when we receive your dispute.

<b>If we receive your dispute within 90 from the date the charges first appeared on your billing statement,</b> we won't start any collection action until we've resolved your dispute. 

<b>If we don't receive your dispute within 90 days,</b> we may offset other VA benefits you may receive. This means we may reduce or withhold part of your VA benefits (like disability compensation, GI Bill payments, or Veterans pension payments) to pay your copay debt. We'll continue with that process while we're reviewing your dispute. If we resolve the dispute in your favor, we'll remove all late charges from your account and pay you back any money withheld from your VA benefits. <br>

<b>If we don't receive your dispute within 120 days,</b> we may transfer your debt to the U.S. Treasury for further collection action.
