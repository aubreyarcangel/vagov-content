<h2>Providing your income when you apply for VA health care</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Why does VA ask for my income information when I’m applying for health care?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

We ask for your income to help us determine if you’re eligible for VA health care based on your income, whether you’ll need to pay copays for certain types of care or medications, and which priority group we’ll assign you to. We’re required by law to collect this information.

We remain committed to provide free health care for all conditions we determine are connected to a Veteran’s service—and to provide free care to all Veterans who have a disability rating of 50% or higher, have catastrophic medical conditions, or who can’t afford to pay for their care. You may qualify for free health care, medications, or both if your income falls below our national limits—even if you don’t qualify based on other factors. <br>

<h3 itemprop="name">Do I have to provide my income information when I apply for VA health care?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

This depends on factors like your military service history and disability rating.

**You won’t have to provide your income information if any of the below descriptions is true. You:**

-	Have a VA-rated service-connected disability, **or**
-	Receive a Veterans pension, **or**
-	Have a special eligibility (such as being a recently discharged combat Veteran or Purple Heart recipient)

If none of these descriptions applies to you, we’ll ask you to provide your income information as part of the VA health care application process.

**Note:**
- **If you served in combat after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11, 1998,** you don't have to provide your income to qualify for 5 years of free VA health care for any illness that may be related to your military service. But you can provide your income to help us determine if you’re eligible for a higher priority group, beneficiary travel pay, or free care for conditions not related to your service.<br>

- **If you were exposed to Agent Orange in or near Vietnam, ionizing radiation in certain service locations or jobs,or environmental contaminants in the Persian Gulf,** you don't have to provide your income information to qualify for free care related to your exposure. But you can provide your income to help us determine if you’re eligible for free care for conditions not related to your service. <br>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What income information will I need to provide?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You’ll need to provide your gross household income for the previous year. So if you’re applying for health care in 2019, you’ll need to provide your gross household income for 2018.

Your gross household income means the total amount of money you—and anyone living with you in your home—earned within one calendar year from all sources before taxes. This includes your total income from work (not the money you receive in your paycheck, but the total before taxes are taken out). It also includes other income like money you took from your retirement fund or income from the sale of a house. 

If you have a spouse, partner, or dependent child who also contributes income to your family, you’ll need to include this income in your application.

<h3 itemprop="name">What if I don’t want to provide my income?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If you agree to pay copays for your care, you don’t have to provide your income information. 

But you should know that unless you meet a VA health care eligibility requirement that’s not related to income (like receiving a Purple Heart or Medal of Honor or serving in certain combat areas), we may deny your enrollment.

<h2>Verifying your self-reported income</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Does VA verify the income information I provide?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

This depends on your situation. We don’t verify all Veterans’ income. 

If the household income information you provide shows that your income falls below our limits and qualifies you for free VA health care, medications, or both, we’re required by law to verify that your self-reported information is accurate. We do this by confirming your information with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA). <br>
[View our current income limits]( http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/).

Because of tax deadlines, we usually begin your income verification process the next July after you report your income. So for example, if you provide your income to us for the year 2018, we’ll verify the information in July of 2019.

</div>
</div>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What happens if the income I reported doesn't match the information VA receives from the IRS and SSA?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

If your self-reported income is below our income limits, but the income we receive from the IRS and SSA shows that you have income above these limits, we’ll notify you (and your spouse or partner if applicable) by letter. You’ll have the chance to verify or dispute this information. You can also send documents showing you have additional deductible expenses that we should consider. <br>
[View our current income limits]( http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/).

<h4> If you don’t respond</h4>
**If we don’t hear from you within 45 days,** we’ll send you a reminder letter.

**If we don’t hear from you within 75 days,** we’ll assume the information from the IRS and SSA is correct. We’ll send you a letter to explain the changes in your eligibility or copay status. We’ll also explain how you can appeal our decision.

<h4>If you do respond</h4>

**When we receive your response,** we’ll assign an income verification case manage to work with you and a representative, if you choose to have one. Your case manager will guide you through the income verification process, and will help you to identify any authorized deductions that may reduce your total gross household income below our income limits. We aim to resolve all cases within 75 days.

**If our review of your information still shows that your income is above our income limits for free health care or medications,** we’ll send you a final letter explaining that you’ll need to pay copays for future care as well as for any care you received during the year for which we were reviewing your income. We’ll also explain how to appeal our decision.

<h2>Updating your income after you’re enrolled in VA health care</h2>

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Once I’m enrolled in VA health care, do I need to provide my income information every year?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

**If you completed a financial assessment only to find out if you were eligible for cost-free medications or for beneficiary travel pay,** you’ll need to provide updated income information each year.

**If we determined that you’re eligible for free VA health care because your household income is below our income limit,** you don’t have to provide updated income information each year. But, if you last provided your updated income information before March 24, 2014, you’ll need to provide your current information at your next VA appointment.

We’ll receive your income information from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA) each year to confirm that you’re still eligible for free VA health care. We’ll contact you only if this information changes your eligibility or copay requirements. If you disagree with the information, you’ll continue having access to VA health care during the time we’re reviewing your situation.

<h3 itemprop="name">Should I report changes in my income even if it’s not required?</h3>

<div itemprop="text">

We encourage you to report changes in your income as well as any chances to your personal information (like your address, phone number, dependents, or other health insurance). You can do this any time by using our Health Benefits Update Form (VA Form 10-10EZR). <br>
