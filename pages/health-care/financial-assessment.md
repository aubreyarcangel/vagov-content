We're committed to providing free health care to Veterans who can't afford to pay for their care. Find out how we assess and verify your income to help determine if you’re eligible for free VA health care—and whether or not you’ll need to pay copays for certain types of care or medications.

We’re required by law to collect this information. We use it to help us determine:
- If you’re eligible for VA health care based on your income, **and**
- Whether you’ll need to pay copays for certain types of care or medications

This part of the application process is called an income assessment or financial assessment (formerly known as a means test). <br>

<b>If you qualify for VA enhanced eligibility status,</b> you won't need to provide your income information. <br>
[View the requirements for enhanced eligibility status](/health-care/eligibility/#enhanced).

<b>If you don't meet these requirements, but you agree to pay copays for your care,</b> you don't have to provide your financial information. But if you don't, we may decline your enrollment unless you qualify based on eligibility factors other than income. We also can't consider your eligibility for free medications or beneficiary travel pay.

If you served in combat after the Gulf War or in combat against a hostile force after November 11, 1998, you don't have to provide your income to qualify for 5 years of free VA health care for any illness that may be related to your military service.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h2 itemprop="name">What information do I need to provide?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You’ll need to provide your gross household income for the previous year. So if you’re applying for health care in 2019, you’ll need to provide your gross household income for 2018.

Your gross household income means the total amount of money you—and anyone living with you in your home—earned within one calendar year before taxes. This includes your income from work as well as any other sources, like money you may have taken from a retirement fund or income from the sale of a house. If you have a spouse, partner, or dependent child who also contributes income to your family, you’ll need to include this income in your application.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h2 itemprop="name">Does VA verify the information I provide?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

This depends on your situation. We don’t verify all Veterans’ income. 

If the information you provide shows that your income falls below our limits and qualifies you for free VA health care, medications, or both, we’re required by law to verify the information. We do this by confirming your information with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and Social Security Administration (SSA). <br>
[View our current income limits]( http://nationalincomelimits.vaftl.us/).

Because of tax deadlines, we usually begin this process the next July after you report your income. So for example, if you provide information for the year 2018, we’ll verify it in July of 2019.

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="verification-process">Find out what happens if the IRS and SSA information shows you have income above our limits</button>
<div id="verification-process" class="usa-accordion-content">

If the information we receive from the IRS and SSA shows that you have income above our limits, we’ll notify you (and your spouse or partner if applicable) by letter. You’ll have the chance to verify or dispute this information. You can also send documents showing you have additional deductible expenses that we should consider. 

<b>If you don't respond to our letter:</b>

**After 45 days,** we’ll send you a reminder letter.

**After 75 days,** we’ll assume the information from the IRS and SSA is correct. We’ll send you a letter to explain the changes in your eligibility or copay status. We’ll also explain how you can appeal our decision.

<b>If you respond by disputing the information in our letter:</b>

When we receive your response, we’ll assign an income verification case manager to work with you (and your representative, if you choose to have one). Your case manager will guide you through the process and help you find any authorized deductions that may reduce your total gross household income below our limits. We aim to resolve all cases within 75 days.

If our review of your information still shows that your income is above our limits, we’ll send you a final letter explaining that you’ll need to pay copays for future care as well as for any care you received during the year for which we were reviewing your income. We’ll also explain how to appeal our decision.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h2 itemprop="name">Once I’m enrolled, do I need to update my income information every year?</h2>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

<b>This depends on your situation:</b>

- **If you completed a financial assessment only to find out if you were eligible for cost-free medications or for beneficiary travel pay,** you’ll need to provide updated income information each year.

- **If we determined that you’re eligible for free VA health care because your household income is below our income limit,** you don’t have to provide updated income information each year. But, if you last provided your updated income information before March 24, 2014, you’ll need to provide your current information at your next VA appointment. </br> </br>
We’ll receive your income information from the IRS and SSA each year to confirm that you’re still eligible for free VA health care. We’ll contact you only if this information changes your eligibility or copay requirements. If you disagree with the information, you can keep using VA health care services while we review your situation.

**Note:** Even when not required, we encourage you to report changes in your income. It's also important to let us know about changes to your personal information (like your address, phone number, dependents, or other health insurance). You can do this any time by using our Health Benefits Update Form (VA Form 10-10EZR). <br>
