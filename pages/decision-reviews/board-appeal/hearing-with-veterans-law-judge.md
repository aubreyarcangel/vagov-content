<b>The form will ask you to choose 1 of these 4 options:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>No hearing.</b> If you choose this option, you can send a letter to the Board that delivers the same message as what you would have said at a hearing.</li>
  <li><b>A videoconference hearing at your local VA office.</b> This will take place at your local VA office (or another facility close to you). The Board can usually schedule video hearings sooner than in-person hearings.<br>

  <li><b>An in-person hearing at your local VA office.</b> This can sometimes delay your hearing, because the Board has to schedule judges to travel to your local VA office.</li>

### How will I know when my hearing is scheduled?

You’ll receive a notice in the mail at least 30 days before your scheduled hearing. The notice will list the date, time, and location of your hearing.

## Prepare for your Board hearing

### Can I bring evidence to my hearing?

Yes. You can bring new evidence to your hearing to share with the judge. But please don't submit new evidence before your hearing.

**If you received your decision on or after February 19, 2019,** according to the new process, you can also submit new evidence for the judge's review for up to 90 days after your hearing. 

### Who can help me prepare for my hearing?

An accredited representative who’s trained in the appeals process can help you prepare. Your representative must be a VA-accredited lawyer, claims agent, or someone from a Veterans Service Organization (VSO).<br>

## Find out what to expect at your Board hearing

### What will happen at my hearing?

To start, the judge will ask you to take an oath that you’ll tell the truth during the hearing.

Then you and the judge will have a conversation. The judge may ask you a few questions, but don't worry—it won’t be like a cross-examination. You'll:

- Tell the judge why you think you qualify for the VA benefits in your appeal
- Answer any questions the judge may have about your appeal
- Share any new evidence with the judge

The judge will let you know if there’s anything that might help you qualify for the VA benefits in your appeal. Your representative, if you have one, may help you at the hearing.

### How long will the hearing last?

Hearings usually last 30 minutes, but there's no time limit. Your hearing will last as long as you need to discuss your appeal.

### What will happen after my hearing, and when will the judge make a decision on my appeal?

First, the Board will have your hearing transcribed and will add the written transcript to your appeal file. They'll also ask if you’d like a copy of the transcript for your personal records. 

Then the judge will review the hearing transcript and the other evidence in your appeal file before making a decision.

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="on-or-after-a">If you received your decision on or after February 19, 2019</button>
<div id="on-or-after-a" class="usa-accordion-content">

After your hearing, you'll have 90 days to submit any additional new evidence you may have to support your appeal. Once this period closes, we'll send your case to a judge for a decision.

If you don’t have new evidence to submit, you can waive the 90-day time period that’s automatically added to your appeal. But if you're working with a Veterans Service Organization, be sure to contact your representative first. Some VSOs will ask for time to make additional arguments to help support your case.

<span id="reschedule-or-withdraw-request"></span>
## Reschedule or withdraw your Board hearing request

### What if I need to reschedule my hearing?

At least 2 weeks before your scheduled hearing, you'll need to send a written request to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals providing good cause for why you need to reschedule. For example, if you, your representative, or a witness are sick or you had trouble getting records, the judge would consider this “good cause” to reschedule the hearing. 

Please include your name, the VA file number for your appeal, and the reason why you need a new hearing date. Send your written request to the Board. <br>
[Use the address or fax number listed below](#board-address-and-fax).

A judge will review your request, and you’ll receive a notice in the mail when the judge decides if the hearing can be rescheduled.

**Note:** If your hearing is less than 2 weeks away, you’ll need to file a motion explaining why you need to reschedule.

#### Will I lose my place in line if I reschedule my hearing?

No. The Board of Veterans’ Appeals schedules hearings in the order they receive requests. You’ll keep the same docket date, and the Board will reschedule your hearing for the earliest date possible.

### What if I need to withdraw (cancel) my hearing?

If you change your mind about having a hearing, you can write to the Board to withdraw your hearing request. You or your representative should send a written request at least 2 weeks before your scheduled hearing. Please include your name, the VA file number for your appeal, and the reason why you’re withdrawing the appeal.

Send your written request to the Board. <br>
[Use the address or fax number listed below](#board-address-and-fax).

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">

<div id="on-or-after-b" class="usa-accordion-content">

<ul>
  <li>Canceling your hearing request won’t speed up your appeal unless you also switch to the Direct Review appeal option. You can only do this at certain times.</li>
  <li>If you switch to a different appeal option, you’ll keep the same docket date and the Board will decide your appeal at the same time as other appeals with the same date. However, the time it takes to get a decision is different on each docket.</li>
  <li>You'll still have the option to submit new evidence, as long as you send it to the Board within 90 days of withdrawing your hearing request.</li>
  </ul>
