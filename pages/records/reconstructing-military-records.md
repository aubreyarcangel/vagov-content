In 1973, a fire at the [National Personnel Records Center (NPRC)](https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/fire-1973) in St. Louis destroyed records held for Veterans who were discharged from the Army and Air Force during certain periods of time. Your records may have been destroyed in the fire if one of the following is true. You were:

- **Discharged from the Army** between November 1, 1912, and January 1, 1960, **or**
- **Discharged from the Air Force** between September 25, 1947, and January 1, 1964 

This page will help you figure out whether your records may have been lost, and if so, how you can reconstruct your military record.
