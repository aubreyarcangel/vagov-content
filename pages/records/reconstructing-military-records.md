### Were my records destroyed in the 1973 NPRC fire in St. Louis?

**Your records may have been destroyed in the fire if you were discharged from either:**

- **The Army between November 1, 1912, and January 1, 1960.** The fire destroyed 80% of the records held for Veterans discharged from the Army during this time period. The fire didn't involve records for retirees and reservists who were alive on July 12, 1973.
- **Or the Air Force between September 25, 1947, and January 1, 1964.** The fire destroyed 75% of the records held for Veterans discharged from the Air Force during this time period with surnames beginning with **“Hubbard”** and running through the end of the alphabet.

## How does the NPRC reconstruct my records destroyed in the fire?

If your records were destroyed in the fire, we'll need to submit a specific request to the NPRC for any additional service records they can find for you.

With the information we provide, the NPRC will search for documents that may help to reconstruct your records. For example, they'll try to reconstruct portions of your service treatment records by reviewing unit records, morning reports, and hospital admission records from the surgeon general's office.

## If I'm filing a claim for disability compensation, how can I get the records I need to support my claim?
