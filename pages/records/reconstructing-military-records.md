<div class="va-introtext">

In 1973, a fire at the [National Personnel Records Center (NPRC)](https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/fire-1973) in St. Louis destroyed records held for Veterans who were discharged from the Army and Air Force during certain periods of time. Your records may have been destroyed in the fire if one of the following is true. You were:

- **Discharged from the Army** between November 1, 1912, and January 1, 1960, **or**
- **Discharged from the Air Force** between September 25, 1947, and January 1, 1964 

This page will help you figure out whether your records may have been lost, and if so, how you can reconstruct your military record.

</div>

## Which specific Army and Air Force records were lost?

**Army records:** The fire destroyed 80% of the records held for Veterans who were discharged from the Army between November 1, 1912, and January 1, 1960. Records for retirees and reservists who were alive on July 12, 1973, were not involved in the fire.

**Air Force records:** The fire destroyed 75% of the records held for Veterans who were discharged from the Air Force between September 25, 1947, and January 1, 1964, with surnames beginning with **“Hubbard”** and running through the end of the alphabet.

## How can I reconstruct my service record?

If your records were destroyed in the fire, there’s a specific request that we submit to the NPRC for any additional service records. This request gives information that allows the NPRC to research for other types of documents. Then, it can try to reconstruct portions of the service treatment records from the surgeon general’s office using unit records and morning reports, and by looking at military hospital admission records from the surgeon general.</br>

To reconstruct your service records so that you can claim disability benefits, follow these steps:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

##### Fill out the NA Form 3055 (Request for Information Needed to Reconstruct Medical Data) to submit with your disability benefit claim. 

We will use this form as our request to the NPRC to reconstruct any applicable records. It’s important for you to give us as much information as you can, including the units you were assigned to, as well as the name of the company, battalion, regiment, squadron, group, and/or wing.</br>

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
##### Gather or request supplemental records. 

Sometimes records called “supplemental records” are very helpful in helping us decide claims for cases related to the 1973 fire. You can provide us with these supplemental records, or we can help you find them. Here are some examples of supplemental records that we can use with your claim:

- Statements from service medical personnel
- Certified “buddy” statements or affidavits
-	Accident and police reports
-	Employment-related examination reports
-	Letters written during service
-	Photographs taken during service
-	Pharmacy prescription records
-	Insurance-related examination reports
-	Medical evidence from civilian and private hospitals, clinics, and physicians that treated you during service or shortly after separation</br>

We’ll accept photocopies of any service treatment records you may have.</br>  

Once you have these records, keep them to submit with your claim.
