<div class="va-introtext">

If you began receiving VA disability or death pension payments before December 31, 1978, and you haven't elected to change to the current, improved pension program, you may be eligible for protected rates. If you qualify for protected rates, it means you're able to continue receiving payments at the rates under the old program as well as a cost-of-living increase.

## How we determine if you're eligible for protected rates

To qualify for protected rates, your yearly income for 2018 must be at or below a certain amount. This is called the income limit. We count as income any money you earn in a year, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

**We base your income limit on:**
- The specific pension benefits you're eligible to receive (including added amounts for Aid and Attendance), **and**
- Whether or not you have eligible dependents, **and**
- Your yearly income 

### Eligible dependents

Eligible dependents may include your spouse. We recognize same-sex and common-law marriages.

Dependents may also include any biological, step, or adopted children you may have who are unmarried and meet at least one of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true for a dependent child. The child is unmarried and:**
- Under 18 years old, **or**
- Between 18 and 23 years and enrolled in a qualifying school full-time, **or**
- Was seriously disabled before the age of 18 and is unable to care for themselves
