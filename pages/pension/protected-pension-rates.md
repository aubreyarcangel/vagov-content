If you began receiving VA pension payments before December 31, 1978, and you haven't elected to change to the current, improved pension program, you may be able to continue receiving payments at your prior rate plus a cost-of-living increase. We call this a “protected rate.” Find out if you're eligible for protected rates under Section 306 of Public Law 95–588 or older laws.

## Section 306 pension rates
**Effective December 1, 2018**

These pensions were available from July 1, 1960 through December 31, 1978. 

If you qualify for the protected rate for a specific pension benefit, we'll pay the rate you were entitled to on December 31, 1978 plus a cost-of-living increase. The cost-of-living increase for 2018 is <strong>2.8%</strong>.

**We base your eligibility to receive these protected pension rates on:**
- Your eligibility for specific pension benefits for Veterans and survivors, **and**
- Whether or not you have dependents, **and**
- Your yearly income <br> 

**About the income limit:**
To qualify for protected rates, your yearly income for 2018 must be at or below a certain amount. This is called the income limit. We count as income any money you earn in a year, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.
