## Section 306 pension rates
**Effective December 1, 2018**

These pensions were available from July 1, 1960 through December 31, 1978. If you qualify for the protected rate, we'll pay the rate you were entitled to on December 31, 1978 plus a 2.8% cost-of-living increase.

We base your eligibility to receive these protected pension rates on your yearly income. Your income is how much you earn, including your salary, investment and retirement payments, and any income you may have from your dependents. Some expenses, like non-reimbursable medical expenses (paid medical expenses not covered by your insurance provider), may reduce your countable income.

### Section 306 disability pension

Your rate is protected if your yearly income in 2018 was at or below a certain amount (called the income limit). 

**Note:** If you're married, we also include some of your spouse's income when we determine if your yearly income is at or below the income limit. The current Section 306 disability pension spouse income exclusion limit is <b>$4,916</b>. This means that we won't count the first $4,916 of your spouse's income, but we'll include any amount above this. 

For example, if you earned $5,000 and your spouse earned $6,000 last year, we would include your full income as well as $1,084 of your spouse's income ($6,000 - $4,916). So your yearly income for our purposes would be $6,084. <br>
[Read more about spouse income exclusion under 38 CFR 3.262(b)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=ad275643432556b9dda942343fb89296&mc=true&node=pt38.1.3&rgn=div58#se38.1.3_126)
