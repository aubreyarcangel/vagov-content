When you leave the military, you may want to convert your Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) policy to a commercial one, instead of converting to VGLI. You may also be considering switching from a VGLI or FSGLI policy. This page will help you understand how to convert from a VA life insurance policy, specifically SGLI, FSGLI, and VGLI, to a commercial one.

## What is military conversion to a private life insurance? 

Conversion is a process that allows you to transfer your existing group coverage to an individual life policy without the need to provide evidence of good health. The converting private company may ask you to answer health questions, because doing so may help you get a better rate. But you aren’t required to answer health questions.

## How do I find out how much coverage I have?

Your most recent Leave and Earnings Statement (LES) or VGLI bill has details about your coverage.

## I currently have SGLI Active Duty coverage

If you have SGLI Active Duty coverage, follow these steps to convert to a commercial life insurance policy:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">
  
##### 

After your separation from the military, but **no more than 120 days** (approximately 4 months) after that date, begin your application.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
##### 

Contact one of the companies listed below, or your local insurance agent, and tell them you’d like to convert your existing VA coverage to an individual policy.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">
 
##### 

You’ll need **both** of the following documents to convert your policy:

- **An SGLI Conversion Notice**, which you can get by calling the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) at 800-419-1473, **and**
- **A DD-214 form** (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty) **or** your reservist orders, **and**
- A copy of your last Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)

</li>
</ol>

Other types of policies, such as term, variable life, or universal life insurance, aren’t allowed as conversion policies. Also, there are other policy benefits, like accidental death and dismemberment or waiver of premium for disability, that aren’t covered in conversion policies.

## I currently have SGLI National Guard or Reserves coverage

If you have SGLI National Guard or Reserves coverage, follow these steps to convert to a commercial life insurance policy:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">
  
##### 

After your separation from the military, but **no more than 120 days** (approximately 4 months) after that date, begin your application. 

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
#####

Contact one of the companies listed below, or your local insurance agent, and tell them you’d like to convert your existing coverage to an individual policy.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">
  
#####

You’ll need **all** of the following documents to convert your policy:

-	**An SGLI Conversion Notice**, which you can get by calling the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) at 800-419-1473, **and**
- **An NGB-22** (the National Guard equivalent of a DD-214 form) or written orders as proof of separation, **and**
- Your final Leave and Earnings Statement (LES)

</li>
</ol>

You may convert your coverage to a commercial policy at standard premium rates, without having to provide proof of good health. The conversion policy must be a permanent policy, such as a whole life policy.

Other types of policies, such as term, variable life, or universal life insurance, aren’t allowed as conversion policies. Also, there are other policy benefits, like accidental death and dismemberment or waiver of premium for disability, that aren’t covered in conversion policies.

## I currently have Family or Spousal (FSGLI) coverage

If you’re married to a service member who has coverage under FSGLI, you have the option to convert your spousal coverage to an individual policy under certain circumstances. (Only spouses can convert their coverage; children aren’t eligible.) **One** of the following qualifying events must apply to you:

-	Your spouse has separated from the military, **or**
-	You’ve divorced the service member, **or**
-	The service member has elected to terminate spousal FSGLI coverage (SOES Certificate of Coverage or [Form SGLV-8286A](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8286A.htm)), **or**
-	The service member has elected to terminate their own SGLI coverage (SOES Certificate of Coverage or [Form SGLV-8286](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8286.htm))

## After the qualifying event happens, follow these steps:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">
  
##### 

After the qualifying event, but **no more than 120 days** (approximately 4 months) after that date, begin your application.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
#####

Contact one of the companies listed below, or your local insurance agent, and tell them you’d like to convert your existing coverage to an individual policy.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">
  
#####

You’ll need **all** of the following documents to convert your policy:
-**An SGLI Conversion Notice**, which you can get by calling the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) at 800-419-1473, **and**
-	The final Leave and Earnings Statement (LES), showing the deduction for Spousal SGLI

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">
  
#####

You’ll also need one of the following: 
- The service member's separation document (**A DD-214 form**, Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty,
or NGB-22, or written orders), **or**
- The certificate of dissolution of the marriage of the spouse and the service member, **or**
- The service member's FSGLI spousal declination (SOES Certificate of Coverage or [Form SGLV-8286A](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8286A.htm)), **or**
- The service member's SGLI declination (SOES Certificate of Coverage or [Form SGLV-8286](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/8286.htm)), **or**
- Proof of the service member's death (Report of Casualty Form DD 1300 or civilian death certificate)

</li>
</ol>

Spouses covered under Family SGLI may convert their coverage to a commercial policy at standard premium rates, without having to provide proof of good health. The conversion policy must be a permanent policy, such as a whole life policy.

Other types of policies, such as term, variable life, or universal life insurance, aren’t allowed as conversion policies. Also, there are other policy benefits, like accidental death and dismemberment or waiver of premium for disability, that aren’t covered in conversion policies.

## I currently have VGLI coverage

If you have VGLI coverage, you have the option to convert your VGLI coverage to an individual policy of insurance at any time. A common reason Veterans may want to convert their VGLI policy is to get a higher death benefit rate. Follow these steps to convert to a commercial life insurance policy:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">
  
##### 

Get a letter from OSGLI verifying coverage, also called the VGLI Conversion Notice (call 800-419-1473).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
#####

Contact one of the companies listed below, or your local insurance agent, and tell them you’d like to convert your existing coverage to an individual policy.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
#####

3.	Give a copy of the conversion notice to the agent helping you.

</li>
</ol>

You may convert your coverage to a commercial policy at standard premium rates, without having to provide proof of good health. The conversion policy must be a permanent policy, such as a whole life policy.

Other types of policies, such as term, variable life, or universal life insurance, aren’t allowed as conversion policies. Also, there are other policy benefits, like accidental death and dismemberment or waiver of premium for disability, that aren’t covered in conversion policies.
