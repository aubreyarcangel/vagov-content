       <h4>Report the death of a Veteran</h4><br>
       Call the VA Insurance Center (VAIC) at 1-800-669-8477 (<a href="tel:+18006698477">1-800-669-8477</a>).

       <h4>Gather these documents</h4>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>A photocopy of the insured person’s death certificate</strong>, showing the date and cause of death. You don't need to provide an original copy of the death certificate. </li>
