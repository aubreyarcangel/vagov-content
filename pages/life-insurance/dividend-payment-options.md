If your government life insurance policy number begins with the letters V, RS, W, J, JR, JS, or K, you have a policy that pays dividends. The table on this page describes your options to get the dividend payments. Only one option can be in effect for a policy at any one time. If you have more than one policy in force, different options can be selected for each policy.</br>

You may want to consult with your financial planner if you need help in deciding which option is right for you. </br>

You may change your option any time by calling us at 800-669-8477. </br>

**Note:** There is no benefit called the “special dividend” for Veterans; it’s a hoax that’s been circulating for many years. [Learn more about the "special dividend" rumor](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/dividends_special.asp)

| Dividend option | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| Use the dividend to pay your annual premium | This dividend option automatically applies your annual dividend toward your annual policy premium. If your dividend is less than your annual premium, you’ll receive a bill for the difference. If your dividend exceeds your policy's annual premium, you have three options. You can use the extra money to: <br><ul><li>Be paid to you in cash, **or**</li><li>Buy paid-up additional insurance (see next item below), **or**</li><li>Pay a policy loan or lien if you have one</li></ul> |
