<div class="va-introtext">

If your government life insurance policy number begins with the letters V, RS, W, J, JR, JS, or K, you have a policy that pays dividends. The table on this page describes your options to get the dividend payments. Only one option can be in effect for a policy at any one time. If you have more than one policy in force, different options can be selected for each policy.</br>

You may want to consult with your financial planner if you need help in deciding which option is right for you. </br>

You may change your option any time by calling us at 800-669-8477. </br>

**Note:** There is no benefit called the “special dividend” for Veterans; it’s a hoax that’s been circulating for many years. [Learn more about the "special dividend" rumor](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/dividends_special.asp)

| Dividend option | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| Use the dividend to pay your annual premium | This dividend option automatically applies your annual dividend toward your annual policy premium. If your dividend is less than your annual premium, you’ll receive a bill for the difference. If your dividend exceeds your policy's annual premium, you have three options. You can use the extra money to: <br><ul><li>Be paid to you in cash, **or**</li><li>Buy paid-up additional insurance (see next item below), **or**</li><li>Pay a policy loan or lien if you have one</li></ul> |
| Buy paid-up additional insurance | This option allows you to use your dividends to buy additional paid-up insurance. The insurance you buy with your dividends is in addition to your basic coverage, and you can buy it at any age. This option lets you accumulate a substantial amount of paid-up additional insurance coverage over several years, because you’ll earn dividends on both your basic coverage and the paid-up additions. <br>This option is available on all policies **except** those with a policy number beginning with the letter K.<br>The paid-up additions will let you:<br><ul><li>Get additional protection for your beneficiaries, <b>and/or</b></li><li>Have cash and loan values, <b>and/or</b></li><li>Earn dividends, <b>and/or</b></li><li>Stop paying premiums</li></ul> |
| Leave dividends in an account that earns interest and protects your policy against lapse | This option lets you keep your dividend in a credit account, which earns interest. These interest earnings are not taxable. You may withdraw money from the credit account any time by either calling us at <a href="tel:+18006698477">800-669-8477</a>, or requesting the withdrawal in writing. <br> This option also covers you if you forget to send us a premium payment. If you do, we’ll automatically withdraw enough money from your credit account to pay one month's premium. We’ll let you know when premiums are withdrawn from your account. <br> The interest you can earn on the account is not taxable. The interest also changes every year. <br> The 2007 rates are as follows: <br><ul><li>National Service Life Insurance: 5.50%</li><li>U.S. Government Life Insurance: 5.25%</li><li>Veterans' Special Life Insurance: 6.50%</li><li>Veterans' Reopened Insurance: 5.75%</li></ul> |
| Leave dividends in an account that earns interest | This option is similar to the dividend credit option, except that it’s not available to term insurance policyholders. The interest earned on this account is not taxable. <br> Also, if you fail to pay premiums, we won’t automatically withdraw a monthly premium from your deposit account. If you want to pay your premium from this kind of account, you need to call us at <a href="tel:+18006698477">800-669-8477</a>, or write to us. |
| Repay a loan or lien | If you have a loan or lien against your policy, you can select this option to pay down the amount you owe. |
| Pay premiums as far in advance as possible | Your dividend goes toward paying your premiums as far in advance as the amount will allow. You’re **not eligible** to choose this option, however, if your premiums are being paid in 1 of 3 ways. These payment methods are: <br> Automatic payment by allotment from your retirement pay, **or** <br> Deduction from VA compensation or pension, **or** <br> The checking account deduction (VAMATIC) |
| Receive dividends in cash | Every year on your policy anniversary date, you’ll get your dividend either as a U.S. Treasury check in the mail, or a direct deposit of money into your bank account. |
