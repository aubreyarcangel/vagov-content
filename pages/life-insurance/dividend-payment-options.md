If your government life insurance policy number begins with the letters V, RS, W, J, JR, JS, or K, you have a policy that pays dividends. The table on this page describes your options to get the dividend payments. Only one option can be in effect for a policy at any one time. If you have more than one policy in force, different options can be selected for each policy.</br>

You may want to consult with your financial planner if you need help in deciding which option is right for you. </br>

You may change your option any time by calling us at 800-669-8477. </br>

**Note:** There is no benefit called the “special dividend” for Veterans; it’s a hoax that’s been circulating for many years. [Learn more about the "special dividend" rumor](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/dividends_special.asp)
