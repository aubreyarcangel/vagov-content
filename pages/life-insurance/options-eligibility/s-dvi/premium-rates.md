## How premiums work

### How do you determine my premium amount?

Your premium rate (the amount you’ll pay each month for your coverage) depends on all of the factors listed below.

**Your premium rate depends on:**
-	Your age, **and**
-	The amount of insurance you want, **and**
- The coverage plan requested

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month. 

### Should I compare these premium rates to other insurance companies? 

Yes. Before you decide to apply for this coverage, we encourage you to compare our premium rates to a few other insurance companies. If your disability isn't too serious, a commercial company may be able to offer you a better deal.

### Can I get a waiver so I don’t have to pay the premiums?

Yes, in some cases. Under certain conditions, the basic S-DVI policy provides for a waiver of premiums for Veterans who are totally disabled. <br>
[Learn more about premium waivers](/life-insurance/totally-disabled-or-terminally-ill/#waiver)

You must pay your premiums for supplemental S-DVI.

## Premium rates by plan 

### 5 year level term

- Available on all programs except those that start with "J," "JR," "JS"
- This is a term life insurance plan. A term life insurance plan means that you're only covered for a specific amount of time (a "term"). As you age, your premium payments increase. After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 
- Renews automatically every five years (5 year term)
- Can be converted to a permanent plan
- Ends if you stop making premium payments
- No cash or loan value

**Note:** If you have a capped NSLI or VSLI term policy, you will receive a termination dividend (payment) if you miss a premium payment om your 5 year level premium term policy. <br>

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month.

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month.

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month.

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month.

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month.

**To calculate your premium rate:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance per (divided by) $1000 by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 29 years old and want to buy $10,000 of 5 year level term insurance, you'd make this calculation to determine your monthly premium payment: <br>

$0.31 (age 29 monthly rate) x 10 (amount of insurance / 1000) = $3.10 / month.
