## How premiums work

### How do you determine my premium amount?

Your premium rate (the amount you’ll pay each month for your coverage) depends on all of the factors listed below.

**Your premium rate depends on:**
-	Your age, **and**
-	The amount of insurance you want, **and**
- The coverage plan requested

**You can can calculate your premium rate by doing the following:**

Multiply the amount of your insurance by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 51 years old and want to buy $10,000.00 worth of insurance, you'll make this calculation to determine your premium payment: <br>

2.57 (Age 51 rate) x 10 (amount of insurance) = $25.70 / month. 

### Should I compare these premium rates to other insurance companies? 

Yes. Before you decide to apply for this coverage, we encourage you to compare our premium rates to a few other insurance companies. If your disability is not too serious, a commercial company may be able to offer you a better deal.

### Can I get a waiver so I don’t have to pay the premiums?

Yes, in some cases. Under certain conditions, the basic S-DVI policy provides for a waiver of premiums for Veterans who are totally disabled. <br>
[Learn more about premium waivers](/life-insurance/totally-disabled-or-terminally-ill/#waiver)

You must pay your premiums for supplemental S-DVI.

**Note:** To get your monthly rate, multiply the amount of your insurance by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 51 years old and want to buy $10,000.00 worth of insurance, you'll make this calculation to determine your premium payment:  <br>

1.28 (Age 51 rate) x 10 (amount of insurance per $1000.00) = $12.80 / month.

**Note:** To get your monthly rate, multiply the amount of your insurance by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 51 years old and want to buy $10,000.00 worth of insurance, you'll make this calculation to determine your premium payment:  <br>

2.29 (Age 51 rate) x 10 (amount of insurance per $1000.00) = $22.90 / month.

2.57 (Age 51 rate) x 10 (amount of insurance per $1000.00) = $25.70 / month.

**Note:** To get your monthly rate, multiply the amount of your insurance by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 51 years old and want to buy $10,000.00 worth of insurance, you'll make this calculation to determine your premium payment:  <br>

4.02 (Age 51 rate) x 10 (amount of insurance per $1000.00) = $40.20 / month.

**Note:** To get your monthly rate, multiply the amount of your insurance by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 51 years old and want to buy $10,000.00 worth of insurance, you'll make this calculation to determine your premium payment:  <br>

3.47 (Age 51 rate) x 10 (amount of insurance per $1000.00) = $34.70 / month. 

### 20 year endowment

- Available on all programs
- Requires that you make premium payments for 20 years
- Face-value of policy is paid to you at the end of 20 years. If you took out a loan against this policy and still owe money, that amount will be subtracted from your policy pay out. 
- Has policy proceeds (payments to you) paid  in one lump sum or in installments
- Has loan and cash value
- Coverage ends after 20 years 

### Endowment at age 60

- Available on all programs except those that start with "K"
- Premium payment is the same for the entire time you hold the policy
- Face-value of policy is paid to you (and coverage ends) on the policy anniversary date that is closest to your 60th birthday (e.g. if your policy anniversary is September 1 and your birthday October 1, you'll receive your policy pay out on September 1). If you took out a loan against this policy and still owe money, that amount will be subtracted from your policy pay out.

### Endowment at age 65

- Premium payment is the same for the entire time you hold the policy
- Face-value of policy is paid to you (and coverage ends) on the policy anniversary date that is closest to your 65th birthday (e.g. if your policy anniversary is September 1 and your birthday October 1, you'll receive your policy pay out on September 1). If you took out a loan against this policy and still owe money, that amount will be subtracted from your policy pay out.

For each plan type (listed on pg. 6 of the pdf), we'll structure as:
H3: Plan type
A brief, bulleted list of plan features (from the table on page 6)
Accordions for premium tables chunked into age groups (see https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/options-eligibility/vgli/ as an examples). Within each accordion, the user should see the table and then, underneath, a reminder of how to find/determine their specific premium rate...we should explain the idea of "if you pay monthly vs. twice a year, etc." as well as the calculation based on coverage amount.
