## How premiums work

### How do you determine my premium amount?

Your premium rate (the amount you’ll pay each month for your coverage) depends on all of the factors listed below.

**Your premium rate depends on:**
-	Your age, **and**
-	The amount of insurance you want, **and**
- The coverage plan requested

**You can can calculate your premium rate by doing the following:**

Multiply your amount of insurance by the rate for your age and plan type. For example, if you're 51 years old and want to buy $10,000.00 worth of insurance, you'll make this calculation to determine your premium payment:

2.57 (Age 51 rate per $1000.00) x 10 (amount of insurance) = $25.70 / month. 





### Should I compare these premium rates to other insurance companies? 

Yes. Before you decide to apply for this coverage, we encourage you to compare our premium rates to a few other insurance companies. If your disability is not too serious, a commercial company may be able to offer you a better deal.

### Can I get a waiver so I don’t have to pay the premiums?

Yes, in some cases. Under certain conditions, the basic S-DVI policy provides for a waiver of premiums for Veterans who are totally disabled. <br>

You must pay your premiums for supplemental S-DVI.

For each plan type (listed on pg. 6 of the pdf), we'll structure as:
H3: Plan type
A brief, bulleted list of plan features (from the table on page 6)
Accordions for premium tables chunked into age groups (see https://www.va.gov/life-insurance/options-eligibility/vgli/ as an examples). Within each accordion, the user should see the table and then, underneath, a reminder of how to find/determine their specific premium rate...we should explain the idea of "if you pay monthly vs. twice a year, etc." as well as the calculation based on coverage amount.
