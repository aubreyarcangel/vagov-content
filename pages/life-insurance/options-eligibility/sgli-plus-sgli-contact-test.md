## Accessing and managing SGLI while you're serving

### What kind of life insurance benefits can I get with SGLI?
  
You can get: 
- Coverage up to the top limit of $400,000—in $50,000 increments
- 120 days of free coverage from the date you left the military
- Extension of free coverage for up to 2 years (if you’re totally disabled) when you leave the military. <br>
[See below for information on the SGLI-Disability Extension](#extension)
- Part-time coverage (if you’re a Reserve member who doesn’t qualify for full-time coverage)

### How do I get these benefits?

If you qualify for SGLI, we’ll automatically sign you up through your service branch. See your unit’s personnel office for more information.

### Can I make changes to my benefits?

Yes. You can choose your level of coverage or even refuse coverage completely. You can also choose your beneficiaries (the people you pick to get the money from your life insurance policy if you die) and change them as needed.

### How to change your beneficiaries—or reduce, turn down, or restore your SGLI coverage
 
**If you’re a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,** please submit your changes online through the SGLI Online Enrollment System (SOES). To access SOES:

### How much will I pay for these benefits?

If you have SGLI coverage, you’ll pay a monthly premium that’ll be automatically taken out of your base pay. The current basic SGLI premium rate is 7 cents per $1,000 of insurance coverage. The premium includes an additional $1 per month for Traumatic Injury Protection coverage (TSGLI). <br>

## Applying for VGLI when you separate or retire

### How do I apply for VGLI when I leave the military?

When you leave the military, you can apply for Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) within 1 year and 120 days from your discharge for up to the amount of coverage you had through SGLI. <br>
[Learn more about VGLI](/life-insurance/options-eligibility/vgli/)

You can also convert your SGLI policy into a civilian policy within 120 days from the date you left the military. <br>
[Learn how to convert your SGLI coverage to an individual policy (PDF)](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGL133_ed2015-06.pdf)

<span id="extension"></span>

### Can I get a free extension of my SGLI coverage if I’m disabled when I leave the military?
 
You may be able to keep your coverage for up to 2 years after the date you left the military if you’re within 2 years of your separation date and you meet either of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true:**

- You’re totally disabled at the time of your discharge and unable to work, **or**
- No matter your work status, you’ve had one of the following:
  - Total loss of hearing in both ears
  - Loss of speech that leaves you unable to talk—even in a whisper—without the help of an artificial device
  - Permanent (long-lasting) loss of use of both of your hands, feet, or eyes, or one hand and one foot, or one hand or foot and one eye

### How do I apply for an SGLI Disability Extension?

You’ll need to apply for the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Disability Extension (SGLI-DE).

To apply, fill out the SGLI Disability Extension Application (SGLV 8715) and send it to the OSGLI address listed on the application. <br>
[Download SGLV 8715 (PDF)](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/SGLV_8715_ed2017-09.pdf)

If you get approved, you’ll receive a notice 20 months after your separation date letting you know that your SGLI-DE will end and that you now have the option to pay a premium for Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). <br>

If you pay the premium, you’ll be able to keep your life insurance coverage for as long as you keep paying the premiums. <br>
