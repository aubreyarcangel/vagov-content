<div class="va-introtext">

Life insurance provides payments to your family and other dependents when you die. To know how much life insurance you’ll need to get now, you need to figure out what kinds of assets you have, what kinds of debts and other obligations you’d like to help your survivors pay off, as well as what other kinds of income you’d like to leave them after you die. </br>

On this page, you’ll learn:
- How to figure out what your financial **assets** are
- How to make a list of what kinds of **debts and other financial obligations** you have 
- How to use our life insurance calculator, using the lists of your assets and obligations, to decide how much life insurance you should get 

</div>

## How does the life insurance needs calculator work?

The calculator asks for information about your assets, your financial obligations, and the income your survivors will need. The life insurance amount you need is the total you get from adding your and your family’s financial obligations to the total amount of net income you need to support them after you’re gone. Then take that sum and subtract from it your total assets—since those reflect existing income that you won’t need life insurance to cover.

## First, start with lists of financial obligations, income, and assets

### What are my financial obligations?

These are what you and your survivors owe to others (existing debts), or income that your survivors will need for planned future expenses. These can include:

- Car loans
-	Credit card debt
-	Funeral and burial expenses
-	Children's educational expenses
-	Mortgages
-	Other personal loans
-	Estate taxes and expenses
-	And other expenses

As you prepare to use the calculator, it’s helpful to gather the totals, or at least rough estimates, of the amounts you owe for each of the above kinds of debts, as well as any other types of expenses you have or expect to have.

### What’s the net income my survivors will need?

This is the annual income you believe will provide the standard of living you want for your survivors, **minus** the annual income that’s already available to your survivors. The annual income that’s already available includes:

-	VA dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) or death pension income
-	Social Security survivor benefit
-	Survivor benefit plan income
-	Pension plan amount
-	Survivor's earnings from work
-	Income from dividends and interest

The **annual net income** is the total of the above types of income **plus** the difference to get your survivors to the amount of income you want them to have every year.

### What kinds of assets do I need to consider when I calculate life insurance?

Assets are the amount of property your survivors would need to have, or sell, to pay off your debts should you die. These include:

-	Investments
-	Certificates of deposit
-	Existing life insurance plans
-	Real estate
-	Social Security benefits
-	Bank accounts
-	Savings bonds
-	Annuities with survivor rights
-	Retirement funds
-	Employer survivor benefit plans
-	And other kinds of assets

## Use VA life insurance calculator

Once you’ve gathered the lists of your debts/obligations, other sources of income, and assets, you’re ready to use our life insurance calculator. For each of the sections and line items below, enter the total amount you’ll need for your survivors, as well as what other income amounts your survivors may have. Each of the sections has helpful information, and in some cases a separate calculator, to help you figure out what to put in each field. Once you’ve filled out the whole calculator, it will tell you what additional life insurance amount you may need to help cover your family’s obligations, and to give them the income and standard of living you want them to have. </br>

As you go through the form, enter the information in the boxes. If you need help understanding how to estimate a number, you can open the accordion under it for more background. </br>

Remember, this life insurance needs calculator is a guide, and doesn’t include every financial situation that may apply to you. For more specific planning guidance, you should work with a financial planner. Note: We don’t save any of the information you enter, and it doesn’t go to VA. </br>
