## 5-year level premium term

**Plan details:**

- Available on all programs except those that start with "J," "JR," "JS"
- This is a term life insurance plan. A term life insurance plan means that you're only covered for a specific amount of time (a "term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage.  
- Can be renewed every five years (5 year term)
- Can be converted to a permanent plan
- Ends if you stop making premium payments
- No cash or loan value

**Note:** If you have a capped NSLI or VSLI term policy, you will receive a termination dividend (payment) if you miss a premium payment om your 5 year level premium term policy. <br>
