<div class="va-introtext">

We offer some life insurance programs to service members and Veterans that are now closed to new enrollees. Learn more about these programs and when they closed. 

</div>

**Note:** If you have one of these life insurance policies and need to make a payment, we require that all payments be made by Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT). We won’t accept other payment methods (like paper checks). <br>

### United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)

The United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) program was created in 1919 to manage new policies issued during WWI and after. The USGLI program closed on April 25, 1951. 

All USGLI policies are considered “paid-up” as of January 1, 1983. This means that if you have USGLI coverage, you don't need to make any premium payments. <br>

The maximum USGLI policy amount is $10,000. Active USGLI policyholders still receive annual dividends (payments).

### National Service Life Insurance (NSLI)

The National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) program was created in 1940 to manage new policies issued during WWII. 

The maximum NSLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active NSLI policy, you can buy Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance with the annual dividends (payments) you receive from your coverage. 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have NSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive certain disability benefits. [Learn more about these benefits.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/gli-claim-disability.asp)

#### NSLI capped term plan

Some NSLI policies were issued as "renewable term life insurance" plan, or "term insurance." Term life insurance means that you're only covered for a specific amount of a time ("term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 

<b>If you have an NSLI term plan, your premium payment is capped at the age 70 rate.</b> This means that your NSLI term plan premium payment will never increase after you turn 70 years old. 

Effective September 11, 2000, if you have an NSLI term plan and your rate is already capped, you'll receive a payment if there's a break in your coverage (sometimes called a "policy lapse") or you cancel your coverage. This type of payment is called a "termination dividend." Your termination dividend can be used to purchase Paid Up Additional (PUA) life insurance.

### Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI)

The Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) was created in 1951 to manage new policies issued during the Korean War. The VSLI program closed in 1956.

Effective January 1, 1959, VSLI policyholders can convert their VSLI policy to a permanent insurance plan or a limited convertible term policy.

The maximum VSLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active VSLI policy, you can buy additional insurance with the annual dividends you receive from your coverage. 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have VSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive certain disability benefits. [Learn more about these benefits.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/gli-claim-disability.asp)

#### VSLI capped term plans

Some VSLI policies were issued as "renewable term life insurance" plan, or "term insurance." Term life insurance means that you're only covered for a specific amount of a time ("term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 

If you have a VSLI term plan (sometimes called a VSLI "RS policy"), your premium payment is capped at the age 70 rate. This means that your VSLI term plan premium will never increase after you turn 70 years old.

### Veterans’ Reopened Insurance

Congress reopened the National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) and the Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) programs for a one year period between May 1, 1965 to May 2, 1966. 

The maximum amount for NSLI and VSLI policies opened during the Veterans Reopened Insurance period is $10,000. If you have an active NSLI or VSLI life insurance policy opened during the Veterans Reopened Insurance period, you can buy additional insurance with the annual dividends you receive from your coverage. 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have NSLI or VSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive certain disability benefits. 

### Paid Up Additional (PUA) Insurance

If you receive an annual payment--called a dividend--on your life insurance policy, you can use it to buy more life insurance--also called "Paid Up Additional" (PUA) insurance. 

PUA:

- Is fully paid for once you buy it. This means you don't need to make any premium payments.
- Has no maximum limit. You can add any amount of PUA to your existing life insurance policy for as long as you want.
- Earns annual dividends
- Allows you to take out a loan. This means in some cases, you can borrow a certain percentage of the total amount of your PUA life insurance. 
- Has "cash surrender" value. This means that in some cases, if you cancel your VA life insurance policy before the policy matures or an insurable event occurs, we will pay you a certain amount of money. <br>
