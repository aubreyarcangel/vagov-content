## United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)

The United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) program was created in 1919 to manage new policies issued during WWI and after. USGLI closed to new enrollees in 1951. 

All USGLI policies are considered “paid-up” as of January 1, 1983. This means that if you have USGLI coverage, you don't need to make any premium payments. <br>

The maximum USGLI policy amount is $10,000. Active USGLI policyholders still receive yearly dividends (payments).

### NSLI capped term plan

Some NSLI policies were issued as "renewable term life insurance" plan, or "term insurance." Term life insurance means that you're only covered for a specific amount of a time ("term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 

<b>If you have an NSLI term plan, your premium payment is capped at the age 70 rate.</b> This means that your NSLI term plan premium payment will never increase after you turn 70 years old. 

Effective September 11, 2000, if you have an NSLI term plan and your rate is already capped, you'll receive a payment called a "termination dividend" <b>if there's a break in your coverage (sometimes called a "policy lapse") or you cancel your plan.</b> Your termination dividend can be used to purchase Paid Up Additional (PUA) life insurance. 

#### Can I convert my NSLI term policy to a permanent policy?

Yes. [Fill out an application to convert your NSLI term policy to a permanent policy.](https://benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/29-0152.pdf)

## Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI)

The Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) was created in 1951 to manage new policies issued during the Korean War. VSLI closed to new enrollees in 1956.

Effective January 1, 1959, VSLI policyholders can convert their VSLI policy to a permanent insurance plan or a limited convertible term policy.

The maximum VSLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active VSLI policy, you can buy [Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance](##Paid-Up-Additional-(PUA)-Insurance) with the yearly dividends you receive from your coverage. <br>

### VSLI capped term plans

Some VSLI policies were issued as "renewable term life insurance" plan, or "term insurance." Term life insurance means that you're only covered for a specific amount of a time ("term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 

If you have a VSLI term plan (sometimes called a VSLI "RS policy"), your premium payment is capped at the age 70 rate. This means that your VSLI term plan premium will never increase after you turn 70 years old. 

Effective September 11, 2000, if you have a VSLI term plan and your rate is already capped, you'll receive a payment called a  "termination dividend" <b>if there's a break in your coverage (sometimes called a "policy lapse") or you cancel your plan.</b>  Your termination dividend can be used to purchase Paid Up Additional (PUA) life insurance.

## Paid Up Additional (PUA) Insurance

If you receive a yearly payment--called a dividend--on your life insurance policy, you can use it to buy more life insurance--also called "Paid Up Additional" (PUA) insurance. 

PUA:

- Is fully paid for once you buy it. This means you don't need to make any premium payments.
- Has no maximum limit. You can add any amount of PUA to your existing life insurance policy for as long as you want.
- Earns yearly dividends
- Allows you to take out a loan. This means in some cases, you can borrow a certain percentage of the total amount of your PUA life insurance. 
- Has "cash surrender" value. This means that in some cases, if you cancel your VA life insurance policy before the policy matures or an insurable event occurs, we'll pay you a certain amount of money. <br>
