## United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)

The United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) program was created in 1919 to manage new policies issued during WWI and after. USGLI closed to new enrollees in 1951. 

All USGLI policies are considered “paid-up” as of January 1, 1983. This means that if you have USGLI coverage, you don't need to make any premium payments. <br>

The maximum USGLI policy amount is $10,000. Active USGLI policyholders still receive yearly dividends (payments). [Learn more about dividends.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/dividends_options.asp)

## National Service Life Insurance (NSLI)

The National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) program was created in 1940 to manage new policies issued during WWII. NSLI closed to new enrollees in 1951.

The maximum NSLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active NSLI policy, you can buy [Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance](##Paid-Up-Additional-(PUA)-Insurance) with the yearly dividends (payments) you receive from your coverage. [Learn more about dividends.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/dividends_options.asp)

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have NSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive [certain disability benefits](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/gli-claim-disability.asp). 


### NSLI term plan cap

Some NSLI policies were issued as "renewable term life insurance" plan, or "term insurance." Term life insurance means that you're only covered for a specific amount of a time (a "term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 

<b>If you have an NSLI term plan, your premium payment is capped at the age 70 rate.</b> This means that your premium payment will never increase after you turn 70 years old. 

**If there's a break in your coverage (sometimes called a "policy lapse"), and you have a capped NSLI term plan:**<br>
You'll receive a payment called a "termination dividend." Your termination dividend can be used to purchase Paid Up Additional (PUA) life insurance. 

#### Can I convert my NSLI term policy to a permanent policy?

Yes. [Fill out an application to convert your NSLI term policy to a permanent policy.](https://benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/29-0152.pdf)<br>

## Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI)

The maximum VSLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active VSLI policy, you can buy [Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance](##Paid-Up-Additional-(PUA)-Insurance) with the yearly dividends you receive from your coverage.

## Veterans Reopened Insurance

Congress reopened the National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) and the Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) programs for a one year period between May 1, 1965 to May 2, 1966. Plans opened during this period are known as Veterans Reopened Insurance. 

The maximum amount for NSLI and VSLI policies opened during the Veterans Reopened Insurance period is $10,000. If you have an active NSLI or VSLI life insurance policy from this period, you can buy [Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance](##Paid-Up-Additional-(PUA)-Insurance) with the yearly dividends you receive from your coverage. 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have NSLI or VSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive [certain disability benefits](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/gli-claim-disability.asp).

## Paid Up Additional (PUA) Insurance

If you receive a yearly payment--called a dividend--on your life insurance policy, you may be able to use it to buy more life insurance--also called "Paid Up Additional" (PUA) insurance. 

**PUA is available for these life insurance policies:**

- NSLI (policies that start with "V")
- VSLI (policies that start with "RS" or "W")
- Veterans Reopened Insurance (policies that start with “J,” “JR” or “JS”)

<br> 

<b>What you should know about PUA insurance benefits:</b>

- It's fully paid for once you buy it. This means you don't need to make any premium payments.
- There's no maximum coverage limit. You can add any amount of PUA to your existing life insurance policy for as long as you want.
- It earns yearly dividends
- It gives you the option to take out a loan. This means in some cases, you can borrow a certain percentage of the total amount of your PUA life insurance. 
- It has ["cash surrender"](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/docs/2018_VALifeBook.pdf#page=67) value. This means that in some cases, if you cancel your VA life insurance policy before the policy matures or an insurable event occurs, we'll pay you a certain amount of money.
