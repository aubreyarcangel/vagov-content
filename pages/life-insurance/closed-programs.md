## United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)

### History
The United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) program was created in 1919 to manage new policies issued during WWI and after. USGLI closed to new enrollees in 1951. <br>

[Learn more about USGLI](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/docs/2018_VALifeBook.pdf#page=18)

### Premiums

All USGLI policies are considered “paid-up” as of January 1, 1983. This means that if you have USGLI coverage, you don't need to make any premium payments. <br>

### Coverage maximum

The maximum USGLI policy amount is $10,000. 

### Dividends

Active USGLI policyholders still receive yearly dividends (payments). 

**You don't need to apply in order to receive dividends.** Any information asking you to apply for dividends (sometimes called "special dividends") is false. [Learn more about dividends.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/dividends_options.asp)


## National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) and Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI)

### History

**The National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) program** was created in 1940 to manage new policies issued during WWII. NSLI closed to new enrollees in 1951. <br>

**The Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) program** was created in 1951 to manage new policies issued during the Korean War. VSLI closed to new enrollees in 1956. <br>

[Learn more about NSLI](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/docs/2018_VALifeBook.pdf#page=20)<br>
[Learn more about VSLI](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/docs/2018_VALifeBook.pdf#page=22)


### Coverage maximum

The maximum amount for NSLI and VSLI policies is $10,000. 

### Dividends 

If you have an active NSLI or VSLI policy, you can buy [Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance](#paid-up-additional-(pua)-insurance) with the yearly dividends (payments) you receive from your coverage. 

**You don't need to apply in order to receive dividends.** Any information asking you to apply for dividends (sometimes called "special dividends") is false. [Learn more about dividends.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/dividends_options.asp)

### Related benefits 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have NSLI or VSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive [certain disability benefits](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/gli-claim-disability.asp). 

### NSLI and VSLI payment caps 

Some NSLI and VSLI policies were issued as "renewable term life insurance" plan, or "term insurance." Term life insurance means that you're only covered for a specific amount of time (a "term"). After the term ends, you can choose to renew your coverage. 

**If you have an NSLI or VSLI term plan, your premium payment is capped at the age 70 rate.** This means that your premium payment will never increase after you turn 70 years old. 

**If there's a break in your coverage (sometimes called a "policy lapse"), and you have a capped NSLI or VSLI term plan:**<br>
You'll receive a payment called a "termination dividend." Your termination dividend can be used to purchase Paid Up Additional (PUA) life insurance. 

### Can I convert my NSLI or VSLI term plan to a permanent plan?

Yes. [Fill out an application to convert your term policy to a permanent policy.](https://benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/forms/29-0152.pdf)<br>

## Veterans Reopened Insurance

Congress reopened the National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) and the Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) programs for a one year period between May 1, 1965 to May 2, 1966. Plans opened during this period are known as Veterans Reopened Insurance.

### Coverage maximum

### Dividends 
If you have an active NSLI or VSLI life insurance policy from this period, you can buy [Paid Up Additional (PUA) insurance](#paid-up-additional-(pua)-insurance) with the yearly dividends (payments) you receive from your coverage. 

**You don't need to apply in order to receive dividends.** Any information instructing you to apply for dividends (sometimes called "special dividends") is false. [Learn more about dividends.](https://www.benefits.va.gov/insurance/dividends_options.asp) <br>

## Paid Up Additional (PUA) Insurance

If you receive a yearly dividend (payment) from your VA life insurance policy, you may be able to use it to buy more life insurance--also called "Paid Up Additional" (PUA) insurance. 

**PUA insurance is available for these life insurance policies:**

- NSLI (policies that start with "V")
- VSLI (policies that start with "RS" or "W")
- Veterans Reopened Insurance (policies that start with “J,” “JR” or “JS”)

### What you should know about PUA insurance:

- It's fully paid for once you buy it. This means you don't need to make any premium payments.
- There's no maximum coverage limit. You can add any amount of PUA to your existing life insurance policy for as long as you want.
- It earns yearly dividends (payments)
- You can use it to take out a policy loan. This means that in some cases, you can borrow a certain percentage of the total amount of your PUA life insurance. [Learn more about taking out a policy loan.](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/1512)<br>
[Apply for a policy loan](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-29-1546-ARE.pdf)
- It has ["cash surrender"](https://www.benefits.va.gov/INSURANCE/docs/2018_VALifeBook.pdf#page=67) value. This means that in some cases, if you cancel your VA life insurance policy before the policy matures or an insurable event occurs, we'll pay you a certain amount of money.
