## United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)

The United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) program was created in 1919 to manage new policies issued during WWI (and after). The USGLI program closed on April 25, 1951. 

If you have a USGLI policy, you do not need to make any premium payments. All USGLI policies were considered “paid-up” as of January 1, 1983. The maximum USGLI policy amount is $10,000. Annual dividends are still paid on all active USGLI policies. 

## National Service Life Insurance (NSLI)

The National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) program was created in 1940 to manage new policies issued during WWII. 

The maximum USGLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active NSLI policy, you can buy additional insurance with the annual dividends you receive from your NSLI coverage. 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have NSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive certain disability benefits. 

## Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI)

The Veterans Special Life Insurance (VSLI) was created in 1951 to manage new policies issued during the Korean War. The VSLI program closed in 1956.

Effective January 1, 1959, VSLI policy holders could convert their VSLI policy to a permanent insurance plan or a limited convertible term policy.

The maximum VSLI policy amount is $10,000. If you have an active VSLI policy, you can buy additional insurance with the annual dividends you receive from your NSLI coverage. 

If you became totally disabled before your 65th birthday and you have VSLI coverage, you may be eligible to receive certain disability benefits.
