<div class="va-introtext">

If you’d like to have your VGLI insurance premiums automatically deducted each month from your bank account, you can sign up for VGLI auto pay.   When you use VGLI auto pay, your premium payment is withdrawn on the date it’s due, so you don’t have to worry about a payment being late. If the payment due date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the money will be withdrawn on the next business day. </br>

When you enroll in VGLI auto pay, you’re authorizing the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) to take money electronically from your bank account to pay your VGLI premiums.

</div>

## How VGLI auto pay works

Every month you’ll get an email 2 business days before the premium money is withdrawn from your account. The email will tell you the date and amount of the withdrawal. </br>

Even if the emails are returned as not delivered, or if the email address we have isn’t valid, OSGLI will keep withdrawing the money every month to pay your premium until you cancel the program. </br>

You’ll be able to see your payment history in your VGLI online account. </br>

**Note:** With VGLI auto pay, you’ll get only email notifications, not paper mail ones. If you want to receive paper notifications through the U.S. Postal Service, you shouldn’t sign up for auto pay.

## How do I enroll in VGLI auto pay?

First, you need to make sure your premiums are paid up to date. If they are, you can enroll from your VGLI online account.

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

##### 

Sign in to your VGLI online account.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

##### 

Choose the checking or savings account you’d like to use for the automatic withdrawals.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">
  
##### 

You can change your bank account any time up to 3 business days before the date of your withdrawal. 

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">
  
#####

If you ever decide to stop using VGLI auto pay, you can opt out of the program. If your premium payment is due when you opt out, you’ll need to make that payment so that your VGLI coverage isn’t interrupted.
Also, if your bank ever doesn’t honor a monthly withdrawal request, OSGLI will remove you from the program, and will ask you to make the payment. You can re-enroll after canceling any time.

</li>
</ol>

## What happens if my premium amount changes?

Your premium payment may change depending on your age. OSGLI will send you a notice in writing 30 to 60 days before the date your premium changes. </br>

Your premium amount may also change if you change your coverage amount, or if you change how often you make payments. When you make those changes, OSGLI will tell you what your new premium will be.
