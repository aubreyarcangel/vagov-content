<div class="va-introtext">

If you’d like to have your VGLI insurance premiums automatically deducted each month from your bank account, you can sign up for VGLI auto pay.   When you use VGLI auto pay, your premium payment is withdrawn on the date it’s due, so you don’t have to worry about a payment being late. If the payment due date falls on a weekend or federal holiday, the money will be withdrawn on the next business day. </br>

When you enroll in VGLI auto pay, you’re authorizing the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI) to take money electronically from your bank account to pay your VGLI premiums.
