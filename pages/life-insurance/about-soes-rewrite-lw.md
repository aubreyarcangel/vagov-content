<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="transfer">Will SOES transfer my SGLI beneficiaries and coverage amounts to my new VGLI policy?
</button>
<div id="transfer" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. SGLI coverage amounts aren’t automatically transferred to your VGLI policy when you separate from service. Your beneficiary designations transfer for <b>only 60 days</b> after your VGLI coverage starts. Once your VGLI coverage starts, you’ll need to add a beneficiary to your policy. 
 
There are some rare situations with legally determined  time frames (e.g. if a separating service member is incompetent) that allow the SGLI beneficiary listed in SOES to be the VGLI designation of record.
