<div id="transfer" class="usa-accordion-content">
<br>
No. SGLI coverage amounts aren’t automatically transferred to your VGLI policy when you separate from service. Your SGLI beneficiary designations are transferred temporarily to your VGLI policy for <b>the first 60 days</b> of your VGLI coverage. If you don't add beneficiary information to your new VGLI policy within 60 days, you'll have no beneficiaries on record. 
 
<b>Note:</b> There are some rare legal circumstances (e.g. if a separating service member is incompetent) that allow the SGLI beneficiary listed in SOES to be the VGLI designation of record.
