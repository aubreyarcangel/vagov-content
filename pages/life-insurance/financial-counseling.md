## Getting help through the beneficiary financial counseling service

This service provides beneficiaries with free, professional financial advice from FinancialPoint, an independent financial-planning company.

### Why should I get financial counseling?

Financial counseling can help you make smart decisions about managing your money and set goals to make the money last well into the future. We’ve all heard stories about service members or families who got into financial difficulty because they didn’t properly manage the insurance money they received. </br>

Good financial planning can help you feel better about the present—and the future. It can help you:

- Make your money last longer 
- Know which debts to pay off first 
- Protect your credit 
- Have extra money for emergencies 
- Pay your children’s college tuition 
- Have a comfortable retirement 

### When should I get financial counseling?

The best time to get financial counseling is as soon as you get your insurance money, and before you make any major financial decisions. Getting financial counseling right away will help make your insurance money last.

## I don’t have a will. Can I create one online?

Yes. FinancialPoint also has an affiliated online service that lets you easily make a will without an attorney by answering some questions. Then you’ll get a legal will, valid in all states, ready to print and sign.

## How to get your financial plan or create a will online

Before you begin, be sure you have your eight-digit SGLI, TSGLI, FSGLI, or VGLI claim number. If you don’t have your claim number, please call the Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance at 800-419-1473.
