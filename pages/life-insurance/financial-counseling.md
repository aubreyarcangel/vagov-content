### Why should I get financial counseling?

Financial counseling can help you make smart decisions about managing your money and set goals to make the money last well into the future. We’ve all heard stories about service members or families who got into financial difficulty because they didn’t properly manage the insurance money they received. </br>

Good financial planning can help you feel better about the present—and the future. It can help you:

- Make your money last longer 
- Know which debts to pay off first 
- Protect your credit 
- Have extra money for emergencies 
- Pay your children’s college tuition 
- Have a comfortable retirement
