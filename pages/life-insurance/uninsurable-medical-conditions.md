<div class="va-introtext">

If you’re separating from the military, you may have injuries or medical conditions from your service that affect your health. Some of these conditions, sometimes called “uninsurable conditions,” may make it hard or even impossible for you to get private life insurance. This page will help you understand which conditions may be considered uninsurable for private life insurance, and it will help you understand your options for VA life insurance, even if you have one or more of these conditions.

</div>

## What are some common ‘uninsurable’ medical conditions?

If you have one or more of these conditions, you may be unable to get private life insurance at standard rates. There may be other conditions that also apply, which a private life insurance company may decide while reviewing your medical history. The conditions include:  

- **Autoimmune conditions**, including rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome
- **Blood disorders**, including aplastic and sickle cell anemia
- **Cancer** 
-	**Diabetes**
- **Heart conditions**, including uncontrolled sleep apnea, transplants, hypertension, bypass surgery, and heart failure
-	**HIV/AIDS**
-	**Liver and kidney diseases**
-	**Mental health conditions**, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and depression
- **Neurological conditions**, including multiple sclerosis, ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), Parkinson’s, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- **Respiratory conditions**, including severe asthma or bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and emphysema
- Other conditions, including severe Lyme disease, thyroid conditions, and ulcers

## I have an ‘uninsurable’ condition. Can I still get life insurance?

Yes. You have several options for life insurance, regardless of your health. You can do one or more of the following four actions. You can:

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

##### Apply for Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI) within the “240-day no health review” period.

During the 240 days (about 20 months) after your separation date, we don’t consider any of your health conditions in your application.</br>

Even if you decide to apply for one of the other options on this page, **you should apply for VGLI right away**. That’s because if you wait until after you’ve applied to a private company and your application is denied, you may already be beyond the VGLI 240-day no health review period. If that happens, we’ll have to consider all your health conditions, and that could mean you wouldn’t get any insurance coverage.</br>

VGLI insurance is term life insurance, which pays its benefit when you die.</br>

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

##### Apply for a free extension of your Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI).

You can apply for a two-year free extension if your disabilities prevent you from working or if you have certain service-connected disabilities.</br>

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

##### Convert your SGLI coverage to a permanent private insurance policy.

This option lets you convert all your SGLI coverage permanently to private coverage. You can do this without a health review **if you apply within 120 days** (about 4 months) after your separation.</br>

These private policies earn cash and loan value, unlike VGLI, which is term insurance and pays a benefit only at the time of death. But private permanent life insurance policies typically cost more than term insurance. </br>

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">

##### Apply for VGLI and to a private insurance company for more insurance. 

If you believe you need more insurance than VGLI provides, a private insurance company may be able to give you more coverage. Even if your condition is severe, you may still be able to get coverage, although you may be charged a higher premium. You could also be denied the private coverage.</br>
