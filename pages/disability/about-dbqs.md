Find out how a disability benefits questionnaire (VA DBQ) can help us determine your disability rating and speed up the process for deciding your disability compensation claim or pension benefits application.

## What is a VA DBQ, and why might I want to use one?

A VA DBQ is a downloadable form that we use to gather information from your health care provider about a specific service-connected illness or injury, and how it affects your ability to function. This information helps us to determine your [VA disability rating](/disability/about-disability-ratings/) (a rating that measures how severe your disability is). 

Using a VA DBQ can speed up the process for deciding your disability compensation claim or pension benefits application. This is because the standardized form makes it easier for your health care provider to submit clear, accurate information. When you submit a DBQ as part of a [fully developed claim](/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/fully-developed-claims/), we get exactly what we need to make a decision. 

VA DBQs also give you more control over the claims process because, for most conditions, you can take your DBQ to any health care provider you choose.

### Do I have to use a DBQ to file my claim?

No. DBQs can help speed up the claim process, but they're not mandatory.

### Do I need to go to a VA health care facility to fill out a DBQ?

This depends on the illness or injury you're claiming. For most conditions, you can visit a VA health care facility or any private health care provider you choose. But some conditions require special training, equipment, or testing that most private health care providers don't have. For these conditions, you'll need to have a VA provider fill out the DBQ.

#### A VA health care provider must fill out the DBQ for the below conditions and exams

-	First exam for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
-	Hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
-	Residuals of traumatic brain injury (lasting effects on your ability to function as a result of a TBI)
-	Cold injury residuals (lasting effects on your body from cold injuries)
-	Prisoner of War examination protocol
-	Gulf War medical exam
-	General medical exam to help determine VA disability compensation or pension benefits

### If I do go to a private provide for a DBQ exam, will VA pay for the appointment?

No. You’ll be responsible for paying for that private appointment.

### How long will it take my provider to fill out a DBQ for me?

This depends on the illness or injury you're claiming as a disability. It can take between 15 minutes and 1 hour to fill out a DBQ. You'll find the estimate of how long it should take to fill out at the bottom of each form (listed as "respondent burden").

## How do I find and submit a VA DBQ?

Follow the steps below to find and submit your DBQ.

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

### Find and download the right DBQ form or forms for your claimed disability

[Go to our VA DBQ forms page](/disability/about-dbqs/dbq-forms/). Search for the form that matches your condition or symptoms, or search by the form name or number if you have that information.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
### Give the DBQ to your health care provider

**We suggest emailing the DBQ PDF to your provider's office.** When your provider fills out the form electronically, we can read the information more easily. 

If you can't send the form by email, you can also print it out and take it to your appointment so your provider can fill it out by hand. Please ask your provider to make sure all information is readable.

**Note:** Your provider must fill out the last section, which includes their name, signature, and contact information. If your provider has filled out the form electronically, they must print it out to sign it. We can’t review any form without this information.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">
  
### Make a copy of the DBQ for your records

You'll want to always keep copies of all doctor's reports, test results, and any other evidence you submit to support your claim.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">
  
### Submit your completed VA DBQ

You or your health care provider can send the completed form to us in one of these ways:

#### By mail

Claims Intake Center<br>
P.O. Box 4444<br>
Janesville, WI 53547-4444<br>
</p> 

#### By fax
