Find out how Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) can help us determine your VA disability rating and speed up the process for deciding your disability compensation claim or pension benefits application.

</div>

## What are Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs), and why might I want to use them?

DBQs are downloadable forms that we use to gather information from health care providers about service-connected illnesses and injuries, and how they affect your ability to function. This information helps us to determine your [VA disability rating](/disability/about-disability-ratings/) (a rating that measures how severe your disability is). 

DBQs can speed up the process for deciding your disability compensation claim or pension benefits application. This is because the standardized forms make it easier for your health care provider to submit clear, accurate information. When you submit a DBQ as part of a [fully developed claim](/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/fully-developed-claims/), we get exactly what we need to make a decision. 

DBQs also give you more control over the claims process because you can take DBQs to any health care provider you'd like, at your expense, for most conditions.

### Do I have to use DBQs to file my claim?

No. DBQs can help speed up the claim process, but they're not mandatory.

### Do I need to go to a VA health care facility to fill out a DBQ?

This depends on the illness or injury you're claiming. 

For most conditions, you can visit a VA health care facility or any private health care provider 
you choose. Either provider can fill out the questionnaire and submit it to us. 

But some conditions require special training, equipment, or testing. A private health care provider 
typically can’t handle these, so we require that a VA provider perform these medical examinations.

#### A VA health care provider must fill out the DBQ for the below conditions and exams

-	First exam for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
-	Hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
-	Residuals of traumatic brain injury
-	Cold injury residuals
-	Prisoner of War examination protocol
-	Gulf War medical exam
-	General medical exam to help determine VA disability compensation or pension benefits

### If I do go to a private provide for a DBQ exam, will VA pay for the appointment?

No. You’ll be responsible for paying for that private appointment.

### How long will it take my provider to fill out a DBQ for me?

This depends on the illness or injury you're claiming as a disability. It can take between 15 minutes and 1 hour to fill out a DBQ. You'll find the estimate of how long it should take to fill out at the bottom of each form (listed as "respondent burden").

## How do I find and subnmit a DBQ form?

Follow the steps below to find and submit your DBQ form.

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

### Find and download the right DBQ form or forms for your claimed disability

-	[Go to the full list of covered disabilities](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_disabilityexams.asp).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
### Give the DBQ to your health care provider

**We suggest emailing the form to your provider's office.** When your provider fills out the form electronically, we can read the information more easily. 

If you can't send the form by email, you can also print it out and take it to your appointment so your provider can fill it out by hand. Please ask your provider to make sure all information is readable.

**Note:** Your provider must fill out the last section, which includes their name, signature, 
and contact information. If your provider has filled out the form electronically, they must 
print it out to sign it. We can’t review any form without this information.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">
  
### Make a copy of the DBQ for your records

You'll want to always keep copies of all doctor's reports, test results, and any other evidence you submit to support your claim.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">
  
### File the completed DBQ

You or your health care provider can send the completed form to us in one of these ways:
