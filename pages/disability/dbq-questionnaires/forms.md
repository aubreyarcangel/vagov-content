## How to submit DBQ forms to us for review

Follow the steps below to submit your DBQ.

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

### Give the DBQ to your health care provider to complete

**We suggest emailing the DBQ PDF to your provider's office.** When your provider fills out the form electronically, we can read the information more easily. 

If you can't send the form by email, you can also print it out and take it to your appointment so your provider can fill it out by hand. Please ask your provider to make sure all information is readable.

**Note:** Your provider must fill out the last section, which includes their name, signature, and contact information. If your provider has filled out the form electronically, they must print it out to sign it. We can’t review any form without this information.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">
  
### Make a copy of the completed DBQ for your records

You'll want to always keep copies of all doctor's reports, test results, and any other evidence you submit to support your claim.
