## What is a VA DBQ, and why might I want to use one?

A VA DBQ is a downloadable form that we use to gather information from your health care provider about a specific service-connected illness or injury, and how it affects your ability to function. This information helps us to determine your [VA disability rating](/disability/about-disability-ratings/) (a rating that measures how severe your disability is). 

Using a VA DBQ can speed up the process for deciding your disability compensation claim or pension benefits application. This is because the standardized form makes it easier for your health care provider to submit clear, accurate information. When you submit a DBQ as part of a [fully developed claim](/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/fully-developed-claims/), we get exactly what we need to make a decision. 

VA DBQs also give you more control over the claims process because, for most conditions, you can take your DBQ to any health care provider you choose.

## Do I have to use a DBQ to file my claim?

No. DBQs can help speed up the claim process, but they're not mandatory.

## Do I need to go to a VA health care facility to fill out a DBQ?

This depends on the illness or injury you're claiming. For most conditions, you can visit a VA health care facility or any private health care provider you choose. But some conditions require special training, equipment, or testing that most private health care providers don't have. For these conditions, you'll need to have a VA provider fill out the DBQ.

### A VA health care provider must fill out the DBQ for the below conditions and exams:

-	First exam for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
-	Hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
-	Residuals of traumatic brain injury (lasting effects on your ability to function as a result of a TBI)
-	Cold injury residuals (lasting effects on your body from cold injuries)
-	Prisoner of war examination protocol
-	Gulf War medical exam
-	General medical exam to help determine VA disability compensation or pension benefits

## If I do go to a private provider for a DBQ exam, will VA pay for the appointment?

No. You’ll be responsible for paying for that private appointment.

## How long will it take my provider to fill out a DBQ for me?

This depends on the illness or injury you're claiming as a disability. It can take between 15 minutes and 1 hour to fill out a DBQ. You'll find the estimate of how long it should take to fill out at the bottom of each form (listed as "respondent burden"). 

## How do I find and submit a DBQ?
