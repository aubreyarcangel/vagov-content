Disability benefits questionnaires (DBQs) are forms that help us give you the right disability compensation for your 
condition. To find the right DBQ for you, you or your health care provider can search either by the condition, in the 
first section below, or the form number, in the second section. Then simply print out the correct form or forms and 
take them to your health care provider appointment.
