All rates in $ US dollars

| Benefit  | Monthly payment | Effective date |

**Notes:**

- Rate changes are payable the August after they take effect. So the new clothing allowance rate is payable as of August 2019.

- For the Medal of Honor pension, we’re required by law to match the percentage of cost-of-living adjustments made to Social Security benefits. These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. You can get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the [Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/cola/).
