<h2>Current special benefit allowances rates</h2>

| Benefit  | Monthly payment | Effective date |

| **Clothing allowance** <br> Money to help you buy new clothes to replace clothes damaged by a prosthetic or orthopedic device or medicine taken for a skin condition, related to your service-connected disability  | $817.48 (paid either one time total **or** once each year) | December 12, 2018 |

**Notes:**

- Rate changes are payable the August after they take effect. So the new clothing allowance rate is payable as of August 2019.

- For the Medal of Honor pension, we’re required by law to match the percentage of cost-of-living adjustments made to Social Security benefits. These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. You can get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the [Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/cola/).
