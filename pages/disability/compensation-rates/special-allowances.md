<h2>Current special allowances rates</h2>

| Benefit  | Compensation rate | Effective date | 
| -- | -- | -- | 
| **Automobile allowance** <br> (to help you buy a specially equipped vehicle if you have a service-connected disability that prevents you from driving) | $21,058.69 (paid once) | October 10, 2018 | 
| **Clothing allowance** <br> (to help you buy new clothes to replace clothes damaged by a prosthetic or orthopedic device or medicine taken for a skin condition, related to your service-connected disability)  | $817.48 (paid either one time total **or** once each year) | December 12, 2018 | 
| **Medal of Honor pension** <br> (added compensation if you've received the Medal of Honor) | $1,366.81 (paid once each month) | December 12, 2018 | 

**Notes:**

- Rate changes are payable the August after they take effect. So the new clothing allowance rate is payable as of August, 2019.

- For the Medal of Honor pension, we’re required by law to match the percentage of cost-of-living adjustments made to Social Security benefits. These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. You can get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website. <br>
[Go to the SSA website](http://www.socialsecurity.gov/cola/).
