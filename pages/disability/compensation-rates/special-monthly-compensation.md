<h2>Special monthly compensation rate payment variations</h2>
<strong>Effective December 1, 2018</strong>

**Levels K and Q** are special rates called SMC compensation rate payment variations. We may add Level K to your basic SMC rate.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="smc-k-q">SMC-K and SMC-Q rates</button>
<div id="smc-k-q" class="usa-accordion-content">

| SMC letter classification  | Monthly payment | How this payment variation works | 
| -- | -- |-- |
| **SMC-K** | $108.57 | If you qualify for SMC-K, we add this rate to your basic disability compensation rate for any disability rating from 0% to 100%. We add this rate to all SMC basic rates except SMC-O, SMC-Q, and SMC-R. You may receive one to 3 SMC-K awards in addition to basic and SMC rates. |
| **SMC-Q** | $67.00 | This is a protected rate that we haven't awarded since August 19, 1968. If we awarded you an MC-Q designation, we pay this rate in place of your basic disability compensation rate for any disability rating other than 0%.|

<h5>How to use these tables to find your monthly payment</h5>

Start with the "basic special monthly compensation rates" table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. 

Then look for your SMC letter designation in the top row. Where your dependent status and SMC letter meet, you'll find your monthly payment.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with a dependent spouse and no dependent parents or children, and you had an SMC-M designation, you'd receive <strong>$4,368.59</strong> each month.

<b>If you have a spouse who's receiving Aid and Attendance</b>

First find your basic SMC rate. Then look at the "added amounts" table. Add the amount that matches your disability rating to your basic SMC rate to get your total monthly payment. 

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with one spouse who was receiving Aid and Attendance, and you had an SMC-M designation, you would start with the basic rate of $4,368.59 for a Veteran with spouse (no parents or children). Then you would add the $156.32 rate for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. 

Your total monthly payment would be $4,368.59 + $156.32 = <strong>$4,895.42</strong>. <br>

<h5>How to use these tables to find your monthly payment</h5>

Start with the "basic special monthly compensation rates" table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you.

Then look for your SMC letter designation in the top row. Where your dependent status and SMC letter meet, you'll find your monthly payment.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with at least one child and a spouse but no dependent parents, and you had an SMC-L designation, you'd receive <strong>$4,099.32</strong> each month.

<strong>If you have more than one child</strong>

Please note that the rates are different for children who are under the age of 18 and those who are over 18 and in a qualifying school program. To find your total monthly payment, find your basic SMC rate. Then add the amount for each child, depending on their age and school status.

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with an SMC-L designation, and you had a spouse, 3 children under 18, and one child over 18 in a qualifying school program, you would start with your basic SMC rate of $4,099.32 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $84.69 for each additional child under age 18 (so $84.69 x 3) as well as the rate of $273.58 for each additional child over 18 in a qualifying school program. 

Your total monthly compensation rate would be $4,099.32 + ($84.69 x 3) + $273.58 = <strong>$4,626.97</strong>.

<strong>If you have a spouse who receives Aid and Attendance</strong>

To find your total monthly payment, add the rate for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance to your basic SMC rate. If you have more than one child, add the amount for each additional child as well. 

<strong>For example:</strong> If you were a Veteran with 2 children under 18 and a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance, and you had an SMC-L designation, you would start with your basic SMC rate of $4,099.32 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $84.69 for each additional child under age 18 (so $84.69 x 2) as well as the rate of $156.32 for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. 

Your total monthly compensation rate would be $4,099.32 + ($84.69 x 2) + $156.32 = <strong>$4,425.02</strong>. <br>
