<h2>About VA special monthly compensation (SMC) rates</h2>

Special Monthly Compensation (SMC) is a VA benefit that we pay to Veterans who've lost, or lost the use, of specific organs or limbs during their military service. 

We use a letter system to classify SMC:

- **Levels L through O** cover specific conditions that qualify you to receive SMC payments. The levels represent the severity of the disability, with Level L representing the least severe conditions and Level O representing the most severe conditions. The SMC rates increase the higher the letter, and more severe the conditions.
- **Level S** covers Veterans who can't leave the house due to their service-connected disabilities.
- **Level R** covers Veterans who need daily help from another person to do normal daily activities (like get dressed).

Letters K and Q are special rates that are called payment variations.
- **Level K** covers Veterans who've lost (including through amputation) or lost the use of an extremity or organ.

**Note:** For all SMC rates except for Level K, you would receive the SMC rate payment **instead of** your standard VA disability pay. If you qualify for Level K, you would receive this compensation in addition to your standard disability pay.

<h2>Current SMC rates, effective December 1, 2018</h2>

<h5>How to find your monthly compensation rate using these tables</h5>

Start with the "Base rates" table. Find the dependent status in the left column that best describes you. Then look for your SMC letter classification in the top row. Where your dependent status and SMC letter meet, you'll find your monthly compensation rate.

<b>For example:</b> If you're a Veteran with a dependent spouse and no dependent parents or children and you have a SMC-M classification, your monthly compensation rate would be <b>$4,368.59</b>.

**If you have a spouse who's receiving Aid and Attendance,** you would then look at the "Added amounts" table. You would take the amount that matches your disability rating and add it to your base rate to get your total monthly compensation rate. 

<b>For example:</b> If you're a Veteran with one spouse who's receiving Aid and Attendance and SMC-M classification, you would start with the rate of $4,368.59 for a Veteran with spouse (no parents or children). Then you would add the $156.32 rate for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. So your total monthly rate would be $4,368.59 + $156.32 = <b>$4,895.42</b>. <br>

For example: If you're a Veteran with at least one child and a spouse, but no dependent parents and you have an SMC-L classification, your monthly compensation rate would be <b>$4,099.32</b>.

<b>If you have more than one child</b>

Please note that the rates are different for children who are under the age of 18 and those who are over 18 and in a qualifying school program. To find your total monthly compensation rate, find the base rate, then add the amount for each child, depending on their age and school status.

<b>For example:</b> If you're a Veteran with an SMC-L classification, and you have a spouse, 3 children who are under 18, and one child who is over 18 and in a qualifying school program, you would start with your base rate of $4,099.32 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $84.69 for each additional child under age 18 (so $84.69 x 3) as well as the rate of $273.58 for each additional child over 18 in a qualifying school program. 

Your total monthly compensation rate would be $4,099.32 + ($84.69 x 3) + $273.58 = <b>$4,626.97</b>.

<b>If you have a spouse who receives Aid and Attendance</b>

You can find your total monthly compensation rate by adding the rate for spouse receiving Aid and Attendance to your base rate. If you also have more than one child, you'll add the amount for each additional child as well. 

<b>For example:</b> If you're a Veteran with an SMC-L classification and you have 2 children who are under age 18 as well as a spouse who's receiving Aid and Attendance, you would start with your base rate of $4,099.32 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $84.69 for each additional child under age 18 (so $84.69 x 2) as well as the rate of $156.32 for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance. 

Your total monthly compensation rate would be $4,099.32 + ($84.69 x 2) + $156.32 = <b>$4,425.02</b>. <br>
