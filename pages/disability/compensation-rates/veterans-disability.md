<h5> Added amounts </h5>

| -- | -- |-- |-- |-- | 
| Each additional child under age 18 | $59.00 | $67.00 | $76.00 | $84.69 |

<b>How to factor in added amounts:</b>

- <b>If you have more than one child,</b> please note that the rates are different for children who are under the age of 18 and those who are over 18 and in a qualifying school program. To find your total monthly compensation rate, find the base rate, then add the amount for each child, depending on their age and school status. <br>
<br>
For example: If you're a Veteran with a 70% disability rating, and you have a spouse, 3 children who are under 18, and one child who is over 18 and in a qualifying school program, you would start with your base rate of $1,609.71 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $59.00 for each additional child under age 18 (so $59 x 3) as well as the rate of $191.00 for each additional child over 18 in a qualifying school program. Your total would be $1,609.71 + ($59 x 3) + $191 = <b>$1,997.71</b>. 
- <b>If you have a spouse who receives aid and attendance (A&A),</b> you can find your total monthly compensation rate by adding the rate for spouse receiving aid and attendance to your base rate. If you also have more than one child, you'll add the amount for each additional child as well. <br>
<br>
For example: If you're a Veteran with a 70% disability rating have 2 children who are under age 18 as well as a spouse who's receiving A&A, you would start with your base rate of $1,609.71 for a Veteran with one child and spouse (no parents). You would then add the rate of $59.00 for each additional child under age 18 (so $59 x 2) as well as the rate of $109 for a spouse receiving A&A. So your total monthly compensation rate would be $1,609.71 + ($59 x 2) + $109 = <b>$1,836.71</b>.
