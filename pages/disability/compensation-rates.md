<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="cost">Does VA give cost-of-living increases for disability compensation payments?</button>
<div id="cost" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes. We’re required by law to match the percentage of cost-of-living adjustments made to Social Security benefits. These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. 

You can get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the <a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/cola/">Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website</a>.
