- Spouse, child, or dependent parent and your combined disability rating is 30% or greater, **or**

### Is there anything else that might affect my compensation amount?

Yes. Your compensation may end up being less than it otherwise would be if either of the situations below is true. You:
- Receive military retirement pay, disability severance pay, or separation pay
- Are incarcerated in a federal, state, or local facility for more than 60 days for conviction of a felony

### Do you give cost-of-living increases to disability payments?

Yes. We’re required by law to match the percentage of cost-of-living adjustments made to Social Security benefits. These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. You can get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website.
