<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="cost">Does VA give cost-of-living increases for disability payments?</button>
<div id="cost" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes. We’re required by law to match the percentage of cost-of-living adjustments made to Social Security benefits. These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. You can get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website. <br>
