Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) are forms that help us give you the right disability compensation for your illness. 
After your health care provider fills out the form related to your condition, they submit it to us. Then we begin the review 
to decide your disability compensation.

## What are Disability Benefits Questionnaires (DBQs) and why might I need them?

If you are disabled as a result of your military service, you are entitled to disability compensation pay. 
The first step in determining your monthly disability compensation is to have a health care provider fill out 
one or more of our disability questionnaires. Then they or you submit the forms to us.  
[See the full list of condition-related questionnaires](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_ListByDBQFormName.asp)

## Do I need to go to a VA health care facility to fill out a DBQ?

No, with a few exceptions (see below). You can visit a VA health care facility or any private health care provider 
you choose. Either provider can fill out the questionnaire and submit it to us. 

## Will VA pay for my private provider appointment for a DBQ exam?

No. You’ll be responsible for paying for that private appointment.

## Which DBQ conditions need a VA provider review?

**Evaluations for some conditions require special training, equipment, or testing. A private health care provider 
typically can’t handle these, so we require that a VA provider perform these medical examinations:**

-	Initial examination for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
-	Hearing loss and tinnitus
-	Residuals of traumatic brain injury
-	Cold injury residuals
-	Prisoner of War examination protocol
-	Gulf War medical examination
-	General medical examination for compensation purposes

## Do I have to use DBQs to submit my claim?

No. But DBQs give us all the information we need about disability conditions. If your health
care provider completes a DBQ instead of writing a long summary, it can speed up the claim decision. 
But using the DBQs is not mandatory.

## How do I find and submit a DBQ form?

We have DBQs that cover more than 70 conditions. When you find the DBQ that’s related to your condition, simply print it out and take it with you to your health care provider appointment. [Read the full list of DBQ forms](https://www.benefits.va.gov/COMPENSATION/dbq_listbysymptom.asp)

**After completing the DBQ form, you or your provider can send the completed form to us. You or your provider can:**

- Fax the form to us. Find your regional office’s fax number.
-	Mail the form to us. The address is:

<dl class="va-address-block">
  <dd>Department of Veterans Affairs</dd>
  <dd>Claims Intake Center</dd>
  <dd>P.O. Box 4444</dd>
  <dd>Janesville, WI 53547-4444</dd>

You or your provider can also deliver the complete form in person to your VA regional office.

## What if I don’t see a DBQ for the condition I’m claiming?

With few exceptions, the DBQs cover every condition for which a Veteran can receive compensation. 
If you can’t find a DBQ for your condition, please call 1-800-827-1000

## How do DBQs help with VA's Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program?

DBQs are valuable for FDC reviewing because they provide relevant medical information. We use this information 
to determine your disability rating (a rating that measures how bad or sever a disability is). And once we 
have your rating, we can begin reviewing your claim. Learn more about the [Fully Developed Claims (FDC) program](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/evidence-needed/fully-developed-claims/).
