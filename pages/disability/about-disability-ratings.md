## How we assign disability ratings

### What is a disability rating?

We assign you a disability rating based on the severity of your disability. We use this rating to determine your compensation rate.

### What does VA use to decide my disability rating?

**We base your rating on:**

- The evidence you give us (like a doctor’s report or medical test results), **and**
- The results of your VA claim (C&P) exam (if we determine you need this exam), **and**
- Other information we may get from other sources (like federal agencies)

### What if I have more than one disability?

We’ll use a method called the “whole person theory” to determine what we call your combined disability rating. We do this to make sure that your total disability rating doesn’t add up to more than 100%. That’s because a person can’t be more than 100% able-bodied. 

Read below to find out more about how we’ll calculate your combined disability rating using our combined ratings table. 
[Go to the combined ratings table](#combined).

### How do ratings work for a disability I had before entering the service that got worse because of my service?

If you get disability benefits for a disability that you had before entering the military that got worse because of your service (called a preservice claim), the amount of compensation (monthly payments) you’ll get will be based on the level of aggravation, or how much worse your service made your disability.

For example, if you had an illness or injury (also known as a condition) that was 10% disabling when you entered the military, and it became 20% disabling due to service, then the level of aggravation would be 10%.

### Can I get increased payments if I have a severe disability or dependents?

Yes. We may increase your monthly payments if one or more of these is true for you. You have a:

- Very severe disability or loss of limb, **or**
- Spouse, child, or dependent parent and your combined disability is 30% or greater, **or**
- Spouse with a serious disability

### Is there anything else that might affect my compensation amount?

Yes. Your compensation may end up being less than it otherwise would be if either of these is true. You:

- Receive military retirement pay, disability severance pay, or separation pay
- Are incarcerated in a federal, state, or local facility for more than 60 days for conviction of a felony

------

## How we determine combined ratings

If you have more than one disability, we’ll use the combing ratings table below to calculate your combined disability rating. 

To make this table easier to use online, we’ve separated it into smaller tables, based on the percentage of the most severe disability (as shown in left column of each table). 

**Note:** If you have 2 disabilities, each rated at 10% disabling, your combined disability rating is 19%.

</ul>

<b>We’ll follow these steps to use calculate your combined rating:</b>

<ol class="process" markdown="1">

  <li class="process-step list-one">
  
  We’ll start by putting your disability ratings in order, from highest to lowest percentage. <br>
  <br>
  For example, if you have 2 disabilities, rated as 50% disabling and 30% disabling, we’ll rank them in this order: 50%, then 30%.

  </li>
  
  <li class="process-step list-two">
  
  Next, we’ll look for your highest rating in the left column of the combined ratings table, and the next highest rating in the top row of the combined ratings table. <br>
  <br>
  So in our example, we’ll look for 50 in the left column and 30 in the top row.
  
  </li>
  <li class="process-step list-three">
  
  Then, we’ll look across from the 50 in the left column and down from the 30 in the top row to find the number that appears where the left column and top row meet. This is the combined value of the 2 ratings. <br>
  <br>
  In our example, this would be 65.
  
  </li>
  <li class="process-step list-four">
  
  <b>If you have 2 disabilities,</b> we’ll round the combined value to the nearest 10% to find your combined disability rating. We’ll round combined values ending in 1 to 4 down, and those ending in 5 to 9 up. <br>
  <br>
  So in our example, your combined disability rating would be 70%.
  
  </li>
  <li class="process-step list-four">
  
  <b>If you have more than 2 disabilities,</b> we’ll repeat the process for each additional disability. This means we’ll take the combined value (before rounding) of the first 2 disability ratings and then combine that with the third highest rating, and so on until we’ve added all disability ratings. We’ll round the final value to the nearest 10% to find your combined disability rating. <br>
  <br>
  So in our example, your combined disability rating would be 70%. <br>
  <br>
  For example, if we add a third disability, rated at 10% disabling, to our original example, we would take your combined value of 65 and look for that number in the left column of the combined ratings table. We would then look for 10 in the top row—and find the number where the left column and top row meet. In this example, that number would be 69. <br>
  <br>
  We would then round this number up to 70%, and this would be your combined disability rating.
